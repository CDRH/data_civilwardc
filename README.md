# Civil War DC TEI

This repository houses [TEI](http://www.tei-c.org/index.xml) XML for the [Civil War Washington](http://civilwardc.org/) project.  It is intended to be used in conjunction with the [Datura](https://github.com/CDRH/datura) repository.

This repository includes TEI/XML-encoded transcriptions and facsimile editions of historical manuscript and print materials chronicling and interpreting the experience of war and life in the District of Columbia during the Civil War.

Note: the ruby script which was used to embed information from the original directory structure into the TEI text element has been retained for reference, but should not be run again
