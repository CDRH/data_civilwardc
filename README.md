## About Civil War Washington

Civil War Washington examines the U.S. national capital from multiple perspectives as a case study of social, political, cultural, and medical/scientific transitions provoked or accelerated by the Civil War. The project draws on the methods of many fields — literary studies, history, geography, computer-aided mapping — to create a digital resource that chronicles the war's impact on the city. Troops, fugitive slaves, bureaucrats, prostitutes, actors, authors, doctors, and laborers were among those drawn to the capital by a sense of duty, desperation, or adventure. Drawing on material ranging from census records to literary texts and from forgotten individuals to the famous (such as Abraham Lincoln and Walt Whitman) we examine how Washington changed from a sleepy Southern town to the symbolic center of the Union  and nation.

This repository includes TEI/XML-encoded transcriptions and facsimile editions of historical manuscript and print materials  chronicling and interpreting the experience of war and life in the District of Columbia during the Civil War.
