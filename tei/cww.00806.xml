                        father's Portrait.</p>
                    <p>It is my will and desire that my servant woman <persName>Maria</persName> be
                        set free on my decease. I give and bequeath her daughter
                            <persName>Ann</persName> to my daughter <persName>Catherine</persName>.
                        It is my will that her other three children, be set free whenever they
                        respectively reach the age of thirty years but until that takes place that
                        my daughter <persName>Catherine</persName> shall have
                            <persName>Daniel</persName> or any other of the three that she may
                        choose. That my son <persName>William</persName> shall have

                            <persName>Catherine</persName> in which case, he shall take
                            <persName>Daniel</persName>, then that the remaining one, and any other

                        proceeds divided among my three children equally. But if they should arrange
                        it, so as to keep the children among them without a sale, they are at
                        liberty to do so and I enjoin it on them, not to dispose of them to hard
                        masters, and to see that they are treated kindly and in due time, receive
                        their freedom, and I particularly desire, that my children may act
                        conscientiously in regard to the Servants, and everything else and may the
                        blessing of God rest upon them all, and may we all meet at last in that
                        place of rest which God has prepared for all his people.</p>
                    <p>I give and bequeath to my daughter <persName>Catherine</persName> all my
                        stock in the Bank of Washington, my household furniture, (Books) watch,
                        plate, <unclear reason="illegible" cert="low" resp="#crl">jewelry</unclear>
                        and all the rest &#38; residue of my estate, real, or personal of whatsoever
                        kind and if she shall receive a larger portion than either of the other
                        children, it is due to her on account of her weak and delicate constitution,
                        and because she has been ever obedient, affectionate and faithful to me, and
                        moreover, received no distributive portion of her fathers estate, which the
                        other children did.</p>
