                                                1865</date>, on which day he had a chill followed by
                                        fever. Dover's powder was given in the evening, but the
                                        chill recurring next day, quinine in five-grain doses was
                                        administered.  There was no chill on the following day; but
                                        the febrile action continued and increased so that on the
                                        24th his pulse was 120, quick and full, respiration 60, skin
                                        hot and dry, tongue furred; and he was weaker, sleepless and
                                        slightly delirious. Small doses of eggnog, chlorate of
                                        potash and turpentine with Dover's powder were administered.  Next day his condition was unchanged; castor oil was given
                                        to move the bowels.  On the 26th the insomnia and delirium
                                        continued; the tongue was dry, brown and coated; the eyes
                                        jaundiced; the urine passed involuntarily, staining the
                                        linen yellow; the abdomen tender and tympanitic; a thin
                                        yellow-colored discharge was procured by the oil.  Next day
                                        the pulse was not so strong, the tongue continued dry and
                       `                 brown, but the skin became somewhat moist and the patient
                                        slept a little. One grain of calomel and two of ipecacuanha
                                        were given every hour for six hours, with mustard to the
                                        back of the neck and chest.  He died on <date type="death" when="1865-10-28">the 28th</date>.  <hi rend="italic">Post-mortem</hi> examination <date type="autopsy" when="1865-10-28">thirty hours after death</date>: The arachnoid over the interpeduncular
                                        space was thickened and opaque and there was serous effusion
                                        in the cerebral ventricles. The lungs and heart were normal,
                                        but there was effusion in the left thoracic cavity. The
                                        liver was large, its right lobe honey-combed, full of air
                                        and of a very peculiar appearance, and its left lobe normal in texture but
                                        of a yellow color. The pancreas was large; the kidneys
                                        normal; the spleen large, soft and dark-colored. The colon
                                        and rectum were normal; Peyer's patches were enlarged, as
                                        were also the mesenteric glands.  [<hi rend="italic">Specimen</hi> 639, Med.
