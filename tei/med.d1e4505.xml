                                        fever. He had headache, pain in the bones and back, and
                                        slight diarrl&#339;a with fever, which was aggravated
                                        daily about noon. On the morning of the 5th there was
                                        tinnitus aurium but no fever; the pulse was 78, skin cold
                                        and moist, tongue coated, pale and flabby, appetite good,
                                        bowels regular. Quinine was ordered. In the evening the
                                        pulse was 72 and strong, tongue pale. flabby, red at the
                                        edges and white at the base and centre. During the day he
                                        had one thin stool and was weak and giddy. Dover's powder
                                        was given at night. Until the 11th the patient continued
                                        without change, a slight febrile action occurring every
                                        evening, manifesting itself in flushing of the face, but the
                                        pulse in no instance rose higher than 80; there was one
                                        stool daily, with, on one occasion, pain in the left iliac
                                        fossa. He usually rested well and had a fair appetite,
                                        although his tongue continued pale, flabby and coated. On
                                        the 13th a few rose-spots appeared, which faded next day,
                                        but were replaced by others and an eruption of sudamina; the
                                        pulse was 68, the skin cool, bowels quiet and not tender,
                                        tongue coated brownish but red at the tip. On <date
