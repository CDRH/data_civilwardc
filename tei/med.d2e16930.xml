     that "exfoliation is going on in a slight degree. He can walk inconveniently," etc. The
     pensioner subsequently entered the Good Samaritan Hospital, <name type="place">Cincinnati</name>, where the injured limb was amputated on <date type="operation" when="1867-04-01">April 1, 1867</date>, by <name type="person" key="xx">Dr. Thomas H. Kearney</name>, who certified as follows: "I amputated
     the leg through the knee joint, the section of the bone being performed through the condyles of
     the femur. The amputation was rendered necessary in consequence of inflammation of the tibia, leading to abscesses and general infiltration of the tissues. Removal
     of the condyles was necessitated in consequence of the want of sufficient healthy integument to
     cover them. The wound he had received involving the tibia, doubtless left it impaired in vitality and prone to attacks of inflammation, such as rendered
     its removal ultimately necessary." The <name type="organization" key="xx">Quincy Examining
      Board</name>, in <date type="pension" when="1872">1872</date>, reported that "the flaps have sloughed from gangrene, leaving the bone
     only covered with tender cicatricial tissue, which often gives away and becomes an open ulcer," etc. The pensioner was paid <date type="pension" when="1880-03-04">March 4, 1880</date></p>
