                                        The patient had a haggard look, but complained of nothing
                                        but weakness and inability to sleep; his tongue was slightly
                                        coated with white fur, bowels somewhat loose, pulse 90, skin
                                        natural. He said he had recently suffered from intermittent
                                        fever. Wine-bitters and quinine were given, with Dover's
                                        powder at night. He slept well during the following night,
                                        but in the morning he was feverish, his tongue dry and brown
                                        in the centre, his bowels loose, and he complained of pain
                                        in the right iliac region; there was also some cough, with
                                        pain in the right breast and <choice><orig>dulness</orig><reg>dullness</reg></choice> on percussion over the

                                        mixture were given and the quinine continued. During the
                                        next few days the typhoid symptoms became more marked;
                                        deafness, fissured tongue and sordes. Milk-punch was

                                        examination: There were old pleuritic adhesions on both
                                        sides, but particularly on the right. The right lung was
                                        infiltrated with tubercle, some of which was softened, and
                                        there was some intercurrent pneumonia; the mucous membrane
                                        of the bronchial tubes was thickened and of a dark-purple
                                        color. The liver was large and somewhat cirrhosed; the
                                        spleen dark-brown and soft. There were patches of
                                        inflammation and occasional deposits of tubercle in the
                                        ileum. The mesenteric glands were enlarged.&#8212;<hi
