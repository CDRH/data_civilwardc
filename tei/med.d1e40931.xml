The brain and its membranes appeared to be healthy; the ventricles were full of colorless serum, and there was a moderate quantity of similar fluid in the subarachnoid space. Both lungs were firmly adherent to the thoracic parietes, but otherwise healthy, except that in the lower lobe of the right lung there was a pneumonic patch about three inches in extent, and a small abscess, with ragged walls, about half an inch in diameter. The larynx and bronchial tubes were healthy. The bronchial glands were enlarged, and black both externally and on section. The &#339;sophagus was normal. Several firm fibrinous bands connected the walls of the heart with the pericardial sac; there was quite an amount of fat on the external surface of the heart; the left ventricle contained a small clot, the other cavities were empty; the mitral valve was slightly thickened, the other valves were healthy; the muscular tissue of the heart was firm; the aorta was healthy. The liver was dark-red, firm, its acini distinct; the gall-bladder contained about an ounce of thin orange-yellow bile. The spleen was healthy. The stomach was full of half-digested meat and vegetables; it appeared to be healthy. The small intestine was healthy. All the coats of the large intestine were thickened. The mucous membrane was softened, and presented a few well-marked ulcerations. The kidneys were slightly fatty; the bladder contracted and empty.</p>
