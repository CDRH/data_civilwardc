    with "shot fracture of right ankle joint, followed by amputation of leg at lower third." The

    Washington, <date type="transfer" when="1864-05">several days after the reception of the
     injury</date>, and <date type="transfer" when="1864-07">two months later</date> he was
    transferred to Harvey Hospital at <name type="place">Madison</name>, where, on <date
     type="operation" when="1864-09-07">September 7th</date>, a second operation was performed by
     <name type="person" key="1288">Surgeon H. Culbertson</name>, <name type="organization"
     key="132">U. S. V.</name>, who made the following report: "The stump of the tibia became
    necrosed from the lower end to its tuberosity. New bone formed, but the necrosed portion was not
    separating. There were several cloac&#230;, and the lower end of the tibia projected through the
    soft parts of the stump. The patient was in an an&#230;mic condition and his system was failing
    from the constant discharge and reflex irritation from the diseased stump. Designing to resect
    the diseased tibia, I made an incision from the tuberosity of the bone down to its lower
    extremity, but on separating the soft parts I found the disease so extensive as to lead me to
    amputate by a short anterior and a long posterior flap at the tuberosity of the tibia. In
    notching the tibia the periosteum was pushed back, the notch sawed off, and the periosteum laid
    over the surface of the bone. The anterior and posterior tibial arteries were ligated. Simple
    dressings were applied after the operation, and quinine and iron was administered. The sutures
    were removed on the fifth day and the ligatures came away on the fourteenth day. The wound
    steadily healed." The re-amputated stump of the tibia and fibula (<hi rend="italic">Spec</hi>.
    3696, <hi rend="italic">Surg. Sect.</hi>, A. M. M.), the latter being well rounded and united at
    its extremity with the former, were contributed to <name type="hospital" key="431">the
     Museum</name> by <name type="person" key="1288">the operator</name>, and are represented in the
    wood-cut (<hi rend="initialcap">F</hi>IG. 292). The specimen shows a sequestrum in the tibia six
    inches long; over the upper part of the anterior border the involucrum is wanting. The patient
    was discharged from service <date type="servicedischarge" when="1865-08-22">August 22,
     1865</date>, and pensioned, having been previously furnished with a "Bly" artificial leg. In
    his application for commutation he described the stump as continuing in "healthy condition."
    This pensioner was paid <date type="pension" when="1880-03-04">March 4, 1880</date>. </p>
