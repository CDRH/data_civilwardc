                                        after death: There was much emaciation. The lungs were
                                        adherent on both sides, congested posteriorly and contained
                                        crude tubercle and several chalky concretions; the apex of
                                        the right lung contained also a small vomica about the size
                                        of the thumb-nail. There were two ounces of yellow
                                        transparent serum and two yellow coagula in the pericardium;
                                        on the surface of the heart was a serous effusion which
                                        appeared around the auricular appendices as a jelly. There
                                        were three ounces of a turbid, reddish liquid in the
                                        abdominal cavity; the mesenteric glands were softened; the
                                        liver was small and soft; the spleen semi-fluid; the kidneys
                                        normal; the stomach eroded and ecchymosed; Peyer's patches
                                        exhibited the shaven-beard appearance; the rectum was much
