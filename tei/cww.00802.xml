                        time at $500. &amp; he has paid all the principal of that sum, except $50;
                        adding interest thereto, it makes your Petitioner's valuation of him $180.

                        knowledge &amp; belief very useful. <persName>Walter</persName> is a dining

                        He has since his purchase by Petitioner been allowed to be at large, &amp;
                        work for himself—Your Petitioner knows of no infirmities or defects of
                        said persons which impair the value of his claim to such service or labor,

                    the present rebellion, nor in any way given aid or comfort thereto.</p>

                <p>And your petitioner further states and alleges, that <seg type="handwritten">he</seg> has not brought said <seg type="handwritten">said three named

                    petitioner's claim to such service or labor.</p>

                <p>Your petitioner further states and alleges, that <seg type="handwritten">his</seg> said claim to the service or labor of said <seg type="handwritten">Three named Persons</seg> does not originate in or by
