This man was convalescent from typhoid fever, but was still suffering from diarrh&#339;a, and was much emaciated.  [The register of <name type="hospital" key="173">Harewood hospital</name> shows that he was admitted <date type="admit" when="1862-10-07">October 7th</date>, but gives no diagnosis or disposition.]  He died suddenly, at 6.15 P.

The heart was unusually small and pale; the right auricle and ventricle were almost empty, the left auricle and ventricle full of blood; the tricuspid and mitral valves were thickened and studded with vegetations. The stomach was distended by semi-fluid ingesta; its mucous coat was smooth and of a pale fawn color. The jejunum was intensely congested; the rest of the intestines was rather pale, but otherwise healthy. The liver was normal in size and structure, with the exception of a fissure an inch in length and about four lines deep, near the external border of the right lobe.</p>
