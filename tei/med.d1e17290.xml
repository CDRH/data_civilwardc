        <name type="person">Private Hiram B&#8212;&#8212;</name>, <name type="organization">Co. A,
          142 Pennsylvania</name>, aged 18 years, received a gunshot fracture of the zygoma and
        mastoid process of the temporal bone, left side, on the <name type="battle">Weldon
          Railroad</name>, <date type="injury" when="1864-08-21">August 21st, 1864</date>. He was
          <date type="admit" when="1864-08-21">at once</date> conveyed to the hospital of the 1st
        division, Fifth Corps, and, on <date type="transfer" when="1864-08-24">the 24th</date>, was
        transferred to <name type="hospital" key="176">Lincoln Hospital</name>, Washington. The
        wound extended from within a half inch of the outer canthus of the left eye to just
        posterior to the left mastoid process. Cold-water dressings were applied. On <date
          type="injury" when="1864-08-26">the 26th</date>, arterial h&#230;morrhage occurred, which
        was checked by filling the wound with lint soaked in a solution of persulphate of iron. It,
        however, recurred on <date type="operation" when="1864-08-27">the next day</date>, and <name
          type="person" key="243">Assistant Surgeon J. C. McKee</name>, <name type="organization"
          key="190">U. S. A.</name>, administered ether and ligated the left common carotid artery
        above the omo-hyoid, an inch and a half below the bifurcation. Anodynes and stimulants were
        administered, but the patient sank under the repeated and copious h&#230;morrhages, and
        death ensued <date type="death" when="1864-09-02">September 2d, 1864</date>. At the autopsy,
        the meatus auditorius was found to be cut across. It was impossible to detect from what
        artery or arteries the h&#230;morrhage proceeded. Both lungs were an&#230;mic. The adjoining
        wood-cut (<hi rend="initialcap">F</hi>IG. 1) represents a portion of the aorta, the
        commencement of the left subclavian, the common carotid, and its bifurcation. A firm
        fibrinous coagulum extends from the seat of ligature to the bifurcation. The coagulum on the
        proximal side of the ligature is much shorter, occupying less than half an inch. The drawing
        is of the natural size of the vessels, shrunken in alcohol. The notes of the case, and
        specimen, were contributed by <name type="person" key="246">Acting Assistant Surgeon H. M.
          Dean</name>. </p>
