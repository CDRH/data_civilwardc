From a field hospital he was admitted to the Depot Hospital, Fifth Corps, <name type="person" key="xxx">City Point</name>, where <name type="person" key="xxx">Surgeon W. L. Faxon</name>, <name type="organization" key="xxx">32d Massachusetts</name>, recorded: "Gunshot wound of arm; amputation."  <name type="person" key="243">Assistant Surgeon J. C. McKee</name>, <name type="organization" key="190">U. S. A.</name>, reported the man's admission to <name type="hospital" key="176">Lincoln Hospital</name>, Washington, <date type="transfer" when="1864-08-24">August 24th</date>, and the following history: "Gunshot fracture of left forearm, lower third, followed by amputation at the middle third. The operation was performed by <name type="person" key="xxx">Assistant Surgeon J.T. Duffield</name>, <name type="organization" key="xxx">7th Indiana</name>, on <date type="operation" when="1864-08-22">the day after the injury</date>, by the circular method. The stump continued in a very unhealthy condition until <date type="operation" when="1865-04-12">April 12, 1865</date>, when it was re-amputated by <name type="person" key="xxx">Acting Assistant Surgeon N.A. Robbins</name>, by a circular operation at the lower third of the humerus. (Compare <hi rend="initialcap">C</hi>ASE 26, <hi rend="initialcap">T</hi>ABLE <hi rend="initialcap">LXXXVII</hi>, p. 788.)  On the evening of the following day the patient received a severe shock on the stump by one of the attendants in the ward falling with his whole weight upon the injured member. On the next morning he commenced to fail rapidly, and the same day he was taken with a severe chill with diagnostic signs of py&#230;mia. Quinine exhibited in large doses failed to produce the desired effect, and the chills continued. A large abscess formed over the external aspect of the knee joint, containing dark and fetid pus. The general treatment consisted of water dressings and tonics, with a solution of bisulphate of soda, half an ounce to six ounces of water, given in doses of two teaspoonfuls every three hours, after the development of py&#230;mia.  The patient died <date type="death" when="1865-04-17">April 17, 1865</date>."  The specimen, represented in the annexed cut (<hi rend="initialcap">F</hi>IG. 712), consists of the upper thirds of the bones of the forearm, and was contributed by <name type="person" key="xxx">Acting Assistant Surgeon J. P. Arthur</name>.  "Each bone is enlarged, but carious, and superficial diseased action occupies nearly the whole of the shaft of the ulna."</p>
