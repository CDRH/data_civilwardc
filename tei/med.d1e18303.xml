        <hi rend="initialcap">C</hi>ASE.&#8212;<name type="person">Sergeant Lyman A.
          P&#8212;&#8212;</name>, <name type="organization">Co. D, 8th Now York Heavy
          Artillery</name>, aged 21 years, was wounded at <name type="battle">Ream's Station</name>,
          <date type="injury" when="1864-08-25">August 25th, 1864</date>, by a musket ball, which
        entered over the right mastoid process, injured the external ear, and lodged under the skin,
        a little in front of the auditory foramen. In the difficult retreat, from <name
          type="battle">Ream's Station</name>, he was conveyed to the Base Hospital at <name
          type="place">City Point</name>, and thence was sent to <name type="place"
          key="#Washington">Washington</name> and admitted to the <name type="hospital" key="176"
          >Lincoln Hospital</name>, on <date type="transfer" when="1864-08-28">August 28th</date>.
        The ball had not been extracted, and no symptoms attracted special attention until <date
          type="injury" when="1864-09-07">September 7th</date>, when <name type="person">Acting
          Assistant Surgeon A. M. Sherman</name>, in charge of the case, observed that the right
        parotid gland was so greatly inflamed that the patient with difficulty separated his teeth
        more than one-fourth of an inch. In the course of the day, he had an alarming
        h&#230;morrhage, supposed to proceed from the posterior auricular. This was stopped by
        compression with lint steeped with solution of persulphate of iron. On September 8th, there
        was no recurrence of bleeding; on the forenoon of <date type="operation" when="1864-09-09"
          >the 9th</date>, he had an alarming h&#230;morrhage, which was temporarily arrested, with
        difficulty, by compression with lint and styptics, until the patient could be removed to the
        operating room, when the <name type="operation">right primitive carotid was ligated</name>
        by <name type="person">Acting Assistant Surgeon W. W. Valk</name>, the patient being
        etherized. The ligature was placed a short distance below the bifurcation, and coagula were
        removed, and the ball, already mentioned, was extracted from near the angle of the jaw. On
        the 10th, the patient was quiet, with a frequent pulse; on the 11th, bleeding recurred, and
        again on the 12th, but ceased spontaneously. There was diarrh&#339;a and vomiting. On the
        14th and 15th, the symptoms were regarded by <name type="person">Dr. Sherman</name> as
        favorable. On the 18th, there were several recurrences of h&#230;morrhage; on the 19th,
        there was much swelling of the face and neck, when the ligature was removed. The patient
        died from h&#230;morrhage on <date type="death" when="1864-09-20">the following day</date>.
        The following is an abstract of the notes made at the autopsy, by <name type="person"
          key="246">Acting Assistant Surgeon H. M. Dean</name>: "Height, five feet seven inches.
        &#42; &#42; &#42; &#42; The submaxillary gland was in a suppurating condition; &#42; &#42;
        the jugular vein was perfectly normal; there was an abscess extending above and below the
        point of the artery ligated about three-fourths of an inch; the ligature had come away, and
        the two extremities of the artery, at the point of ligation, were covered with pus." The
        wound already adverted to, behind the right ear, was connected with an abscess, which
        extended down to the angle of the inferior maxilla, and contained a dark-colored fetid pus.
        The artery from which the h&#230;morrhage came was not detected. The case is reported by
          <name type="person">Drs. Sherman</name> and <name type="person" key="246">Dean</name>, and
          <name type="person" key="243">Surgeon McKee</name>, in his quarterly report, gives no
        further remarks on the case by <name type="person">Dr. Valk</name>. The pathological
        specimen, figured in the wood-cut, shows one-third of the calibre of the vessel undivided.
        In the wood-cut (<hi rend="initialcap">F</hi>IG. 177), the ligature on the internal carotid
        was apparently, as <name type="person">Dr. Woodhull</name> has remarked, an experiment upon
        the cadaver. </p>
