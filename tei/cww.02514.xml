            </opener>
            
            <div>
                <p><emph rend="smallcaps">The</emph> above named city having for long years <lb/>maintained the reputation of being the greatest <lb/>slave-mart in the country; our mind invariably <lb/>turned to it as a place more deserving of <choice><orig>de-<lb/>struction</orig><reg>destruction</reg></choice> than Sodom and Gomorrah or any of <lb/>the cities of the plains of Nod.</p>
                
                <p>Our anxiety to visit it was very great, as <lb/>we wanted to gaze upon its streets, and upon <lb/>the slave-pens, of which we had read so much; <lb/>but we will confess that it was not without <lb/>some fear that we consented to go thither, for <lb/>although it is within the Union lines, it <lb/>contains this day more secessionists than <lb/>any place of its size in the country.  Its <lb/>colored population all testify to this fact, as <lb/>they receive more insults in that place in one <lb/>week, than they do in Washington during a <lb/>whole year.</p>
                
                <p>Our paper would fail in size, were we to <choice><orig>at-<lb/>tempt</orig><reg>attempt</reg></choice> to chronicle all the outrages which have <lb/>been committed upon our people there lately; <lb/>but one example must suffice.  On the 19th of <lb/>last month, Mr. Paris Simms, a peaceable and <lb/>unoffending colored man, was stabbed by a <lb/>Union soldier (so called), in the day time, <lb/>without the slightest provocation; but we are <lb/>happy to say that the offender was caught, and <lb/>is now in jail.</p>
                
                <p>On the morning of the 20th <choice><orig>ult.</orig><reg>ultimate</reg></choice>, we were <lb/>invited by Mr. Chas. Johnson, a gentleman of <lb/>color, sutler to the 3d Wisconsin Volunteers, <lb/>to take a ride with him to Alexandria, and we <lb/>gladly accepted the invitation.</p>
                
                <p>In passing over the Long Bridge which <lb/>leads out of Washington, we met several of <lb/>Mr. J's. wagons driven by white men.  The <lb/>greeting was very cordial and the men received <lb/>their orders with as much cheerfulness as <lb/>though he had been as white as snow.  We <lb/>have since learned that Mr. J. is a man of much <lb/>influence and is highly respected by the whole <lb/>12th Corps of which his regiment forms a <lb/>part.</p>
                
                <p>On entering Alexandria the curse of slavery <lb/>is broadly manifest, dilapidation and sloth <lb/>stare you in the face on every hand except <lb/>where the new order of things is cropping out. <lb/>Many of the houses are without paint; fences <lb/>are broken downâ€”and tidiness is seen nowhere <lb/>except about a few of the better built houses <lb/>now occupied by Union men and Northern <lb/>troopsâ€”the latter, by the way, occupy some of <lb/>the best houses in town, once the property of <lb/>secessionists.</p>
                
                <p>The number of colored people in the city is <lb/>very great, and increasing daily, which is <lb/>owing to the fact that all making their escape <lb/>to Mead's army are forwarded by railway to <lb/>this place, where they get plenty of work and <lb/>good wages.  One of the most pleasing facts <lb/>about these people is the rapidity with which <lb/>they acquire the habits and feelings of freemen. <lb/>There is a settlement of them in the Northern <lb/>part of the city, called Petersburg (because <lb/>most of them came from that part of Virginia), <lb/>that occupies about three blocks.  Here they <lb/>enjoy the rights and begin to realize the <choice><orig>re-<lb/>sponsibilities</orig><reg>responsibilities</reg></choice> of freemen.  We shall not very <lb/>soon forget an expression that fell from the <lb/>mouth of one of them as he left his humble <lb/>home at early morn, to pursue his daily <choice><orig>avoca-<lb/>tion</orig><reg>avocation</reg></choice>.  Ourself and friend Hinton were taking <lb/>an early stroll at the time when we heard the <lb/>question and its ever memorable answer. <lb/>First Contrabandâ€”"How is you old boy?" <choice><orig>Se-<lb/>cond</orig><reg>Second</reg></choice> Contrabandâ€”<emph rend="italic">"Everything is lovely."</emph>  Ah! <lb/>thought we, how appropriate the answer, and <lb/>how countless the volumes that it speaks.  The <lb/>question was a personal one; but the answer <lb/>speaks of liberty, secured to himself and the <lb/>dear ones in that humble shantyâ€”of health <lb/>vouchsafed to all beneath its roofâ€”of constant <lb/>and remunerated labor, secured to him by the <lb/>government, and of all the blessings of <choice><orig>free-<lb/>dom</orig><reg>freedom</reg></choice> which he then enjoyed.  Yes, our long <lb/>oppressed brother, <emph rend="italic">"everything is lovely,"</emph> now; <lb/>but the beauties of the coming time, when the <lb/>rays of the sun of liberty shall penetrate every <lb/>lowly cabin in the South, shall so far transcend <lb/>those of the present, that they will appear as <lb/>but the glimmerings of the early morn, to the <lb/>effulgence of the noonday's sun.</p>

                <p>We had a very pleasant visit to the schools <lb/>of Alexandria, the largest of which is kept by <lb/>the Rev. Messrs. â€”â€”, gentlemen of color, <lb/>in an old, but commodious school house, built <lb/>for poor whites, by funds left by Gen. <choice><orig>Wash-<lb/>ington</orig><reg>Washington</reg></choice>.  None that believe in the return of <lb/>spirits to this earth, can doubt that his has many <lb/>times left its heavenly abode to visit, and look <lb/>with approval upon the scenes now witnessed <lb/>in that old building erected by his munificence. <lb/>The children showed great perfection in the <choice><orig>re-<lb/>cital</orig><reg>recital</reg></choice> of their lessons and their singing was most <lb/>excellent.  There was one boy in this school <lb/>who, although he had been there but a very <lb/>short time, could write better than one of his <lb/>teachers and can spell any word in the <choice><orig>spell-<lb/>ing-book</orig><reg>spelling-book</reg></choice> without seeing it.</p>
                
                <p>Miss Mary E. Chase, a young lady of <choice><orig>daunt-<lb/>less</orig><reg>dauntless</reg></choice> courage, and who knows how to maintain <lb/>the reputation of her native South for <choice><orig>hospi-<lb/>tality</orig><reg>hospitality</reg></choice>, also teaches school here.  Her scholars <lb/>are all small, but they all looked as though <lb/>they had come out of a band box.  Their <lb/>spelling and reading were excellent, but their <lb/>great delight was in singing.  We left a song <lb/>of four eight-line stanzas with their teacher, <lb/>and on returning four days after we found that <lb/>they had learned every word of it, and their <lb/>little eyes sparkled with delight, as they at the <lb/>top of their voice poured it forth in song.</p>

            <div>
                <head type="main" subtype="authorial" rend="center">THE SCHOOL FOR CONTRABANDS.</head>
                
                <p>This school is situated in a portion of the <lb/>barracks erected for the contrabands, and is <lb/>taught by a white gentleman, who having lost <lb/>his health while campaigning in Virginia, <lb/>found congenial employment in teaching these <lb/>despised ones.  His school is very full, and is <lb/>kept in the most perfect order.  The children <lb/>show wonderful aptitude.  We saw a class of <lb/>them who had been but <emph rend="italic">three weeks in school <lb/>read short sentences on the black board.</emph>  Their <lb/>teacher appeared to be very proud of them, as <lb/>well he might, for the scene presented by them <lb/>was truly wonderful.</p>
                
                <p>Many of the children were still dressed in <lb/>summer clothes although the season is so far <lb/>advancedâ€”some of the clothing was in tatters. <lb/></p>
                
                <p>Mr. Hinton addressed them in some remarks <lb/>
                    well suited to their capacity, but at the same <lb/>time earnest and eloquent.  We, by invitation <lb/>added a few words, and sung an anti-slavery <lb/>song, in which the little ones joined us most <lb/>heartily.</p>
                
                <p>Of the freedmen and their "superintendent," <lb/>of the other schools, and of the people, <choice><orig>institu-<lb/>tions</orig><reg>institutions</reg></choice> and churches of Alexandria, we will give <lb/>some account of in our next.</p>
