      of the 1st division, Fifth Corps, with "severe wound of left leg, caused by a musket
      ball."  <date type="transfer" when="1864-10-07">A week later</date> the man was transferred to <name type="hospital" key="173">Harewood
      Hospital</name>, Washington, whence <name type="person" key="158">Surgeon R. B.
      Bontecou</name>, <name type="organization" key="132">U. S. V.</name>, contributed the specimen
     and reported the result of the case: "The leg was wounded in the lower third, the ball passing
     anterior to the tibia and injuring the periosteum. The patient, although weak, did tolerably
     well up to October 13th, at which time the parts became gangrenous, destroying the tissues from
     the ankle joint to the upper part of the middle third of the leg and leaving the tibia exposed
     for about six inches. Under the application of escharotics the wound became healthy and the
     limb improved until January 2, 1865, when gangrene reappeared and the tissues of the heel
     commenced sloughing, the exposed tibia being necrosed and exfoliating. In addition to
     escharotics the treatment was supporting throughout. The patient died of exhaustion <date
      type="death" when="1865-01-26">January 26, 1865</date>." The specimen (No. 3609, <hi rend="italic">Surgical
     Section</hi>, A. M. M.) consists of the tibia, and shows one longitudinal half of the bone to be necrosed and nearly separated, the other portion being
     sheathed with callus. </p>
