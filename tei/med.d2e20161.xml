      Heakin</name>, <name type="organization" key="112">Co. D, 6th U. S. Cavalry</name>, aged 24
     years, was wounded in the right ankle, at the battle of <name type="BATTLE" key="96">Old Church</name>, <date type="injury" when="1864-05-31">May 31, 1864</date>. He was admitted to
     <name type="hospital" key="175">Stanton Hospital</name>, Washington, <date type="admit" when="1864-06-04">four days afterwards</date>,
     where amputation was performed by <name type="person" key="70">Surgeon J. A. Lidell</name>,
     <name type="organization" key="132">U. S. V.</name>, who made the following report:&#185;  "The wound was inflicted by a mini&#233; ball,
     which entered anteriorly, passed backward and inward, apparently going close to the posterior
     tibial artery and escaping behind the lower end of the tibia. The ankle joint was involved. The
     parts became swollen, red, and tender. During the night of June 7th the patient had secondary
     h&#230;morrhage from the wound, losing about a pint of blood, bright red in color. On <date type="operation" when="1864-06-08">the following day</date> the leg was amputated at the place of election by double flap method, the
     anterior flap being shorter than the posterior, and the tibia being divided after the procedure
     of Sanson. Sulphuric ether constituted the an&#230;sthetic. The loss of blood was trifling
     during the operation and the patient's general condition at the time was favorable, there being
     no constitutional disturbance worth mentioning. The shock of the operation was little and
     passed away quickly; reaction moderate. The patient died of py&#230;mia <date type="death"
      when="1864-06-21">June 21, 1864</date>. The examination of the injured member showed the lower
     end of the tibia to be badly comminuted into the ankle joint, which was filled with pus. The
     posterior tibial artery was grazed by the bullet and some very small fragments of bone had been
     driven into it. The h&#230;morrhage occurred on the detaching of these fragments by
     suppuration, together with the separation of the bruised tissue belonging to the wall of the
     artery. The <choice><orig>astragalus</orig><reg>talus</reg></choice> was uninjured." The latter bone and the lower portion of the amputated
     tibia (<hi rend="italic">Spec</hi>. 2470) were contributed to <name type="hospital"
      key="431">the  Museum</name> by <name type="person" key="70">the operator</name>, and are represented in the wood-cut (<hi
