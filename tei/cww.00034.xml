                        the value of his claim should conclude with an averment that he has no

                    thereof, said <seg type="handwritten">Slave <persName>Harriet</persName></seg>
                    was held to service or labor therein under and by virtue of your petitioner's

                <p>Your petitioner further states and alleges, that <seg type="handwritten"

                <p>And your petitioner prays the said Commissioners to investigate and determine the

                    herein above set forth; and if the same be found to be valid, that they appraise
