                                                  a conoidal ball, which entered the body of the

                                                  bones. He was conveyed by steamer to <name type="place" key="#Washington">Washington</name>,

                                                  difficult from the fact that the passage of the
                                                  ball through the buccal cavity had produced

                                                  administered; while the particles of food and
                                                  salivary secretions could only effectually be
                                                  removed by syringing through both wounds of
                                                  entrance and exit. Secondary h&#230;morrhage from the
                                                  internal maxillary and facial arteries occurred

                                                  The sinking of the patient was so decided as to be
                                                  beyond the control of any operative measures or
                                                  medicinal treatment. The patient died <date type="death" when="1865-04-09">April 9th, 1865</date>. The <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> examination showed that the
                                                  facial artery, at the point where it passes over
                                                  the inferior maxilla, had been laid open. The case
