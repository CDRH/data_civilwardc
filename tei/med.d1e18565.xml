                                                  lodged just under the right clavicle where the
                                                  subclavian emerges. He was conveyed to <name type="place" key="#Washington">Washington, D. C.</name>, and admitted into <name type="hospital" key="169">St. Aloysius Hospital</name>,

                                                  referred particularly to the elbow-joint and
                                                  fingers, the fingers remaining semi-flexed three
                                                  months. He was unable to speak aloud for two
                                                  weeks, and nourishment could only be taken in
                                                  liquid form. The limb was carried at right angles,
                                                  and, by the middle of July, the wound had

                                                  right angles, from inaction, was straightened
                                                  while the patient was under the influence of
                                                  chloroform, and frequent flexion and extension
                                                  subsequently fully restored the use of the joint.

                                                  and heat, and, at times, were very painful. One
                                                  morning, in the fall of 1865, he found that the
                                                  power of supporting the head was lost to such an
                                                  extent, that he was unable to rise from his bed;
                                                  and clonic muscular contraction, drawing the head
                                                  to the right shoulder, lasted four days, but did
                                                  not recur. Late in December, 1869, the pain at the

                                                  having placed the patient under the influence of
                                                  chloroform, cut down and <name type="operation">removed the ball</name>, which
                                                  was found thrust in between the subclavian and a
                                                  branch of the brachial plexus, the missile resting
                                                  on the artery just where it emerges from beneath
                                                  the clavicle, and the nerve drawn tightly across
                                                  the ball in front. On pushing aside this nerve
                                                  from the missile, vigorous contraction of the limb
                                                  was produced. The wound closed readily by
                                                  granulation. The limb is now equal to its fellow
                                                  in size and strength, and, with the exception of a
                                                  very slight sensitiveness of the fingers to cold
                                                  and heat, which is improving, the patient is
                                                  entirely relieved. He is unwilling to present the
                                                  ball to the Museum. <name type="person">Mr. Cottrell</name> is a clerk in the
