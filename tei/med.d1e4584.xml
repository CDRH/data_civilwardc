                                                1861</date>, having been sick since <date type="injury" when="1861-09-01">the 1st</date> with
                                        headache, pain in the back and fever, aggravated at night,
                                        but not preceded by a chill. On admission his face was
                                        flushed, pulse 79, tongue white and coated, skin warm and
                                        sweating; he had epistaxis and a few rose-colored spots on
                                        the abdomen. Next day the tongue was moist, brown-coated in
                                        the centre and red at the tip and edges; the bowels were
                                        quiet but tender on pressure. Quinine was taken during the
                                        day and Dover's powder at night. On the 11th the patient was
                                        dull and prostrated, pulse 68 and feeble; but in the evening
                                        there was much restlessness with high fever, pulse 90 and
                                        strong. Next morning a remission occurred, followed by an
                                        exacerbation in the evening; the tongue was pale, flabby and
                                        coated brown, and the bowels continued quiet. On the 13th
                                        the evening exacerbation was not so marked, but the tongue
                                        was heavily coated gray and the skin and
                                        conjunctivæ were jaundiced. Blue-mass was given in
                                        addition to the quinine. On the 15th two large stools were
                                        passed, and in the evening three free, thin and painless
                                        stools. Aromatic sulphuric acid was prescribed. On the 16th
                                        the pulse was 62, the tongue pale and heavily coated gray,
                                        the bowels quiet, the jaundice disappearing; there were
                                        rose-colored spots and a profusion of sudamina on the skin,
                                        which perspired freely. Rose-colored spots appeared again on
                                        the 18th; the bowels continued quiet and the evening
                                        accession became less manifest; night-sweats were profuse.
                                        On <date type="duty" when="1861-10-01">October 1</date> the
                                        patient had so far recovered as to be placed on light duty.
