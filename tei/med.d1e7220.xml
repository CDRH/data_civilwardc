                                        on account of inguinal hernia on the right side and enlarged
                                        inguinal glands.  On April 6, 1865, the records present him
                                        as feverish and jaundiced, without giving information as to
                                        the period of onset. His pulse was 95, tongue coated with a
                                        yellowish fur, skin dry; he had thirst, anorexia, nausea,
                                        tenderness in the right iliac region and constipated bowels;
                                        there was some mental torpor and considerable muscular
                                        debility.  On the 8th his pulse was small and frequent; he
                                        had a cough and complained of pain in the right side of the
                                        chest. He died <date type="death" when="1865-04-09">next day</date>.  A mercurial purge operated well on the
                                        6th; subsequently the bowels were so loose that opium was
                                        employed. Quinine and stimulants were freely administered.
                                        The case is recorded by the attending physician as one of
                                        typho-malarial fever.  <hi rend="italic">Post-mortem</hi>

                                        very light-colored and soft; the spleen and kidneys softened
                                        and congested. The whole of the intestinal canal was
                                        inflamed; the mesenteric glands enlarged. The peritoneum was
                                        inflamed and the sac contained about half a pint of
                                        sero-purulent liquid.&#8212;<hi rend="italic"><name
