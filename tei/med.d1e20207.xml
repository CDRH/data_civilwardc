                                                  condition was good. On October 11th, h&#230;mothorax
                                                  was diagnosed. The right lung was compressed,
                                                  there was dullness on percussion, an absence of

                                                  axillaris; five quarts of blood and serum were
                                                  removed. The patient felt much relief after the
                                                  operation, respiration becoming easy and audible
                                                  through the whole of the right lung, except in the
                                                  inferior part of the third lobe. The wound was
                                                  covered with oil-silk to prevent the admission of
                                                  air, and a Dover's powder was given every three
                                                  hours. The case progressed as follows: October 12th, pulse 120. October 13th, feels pretty well;
                                                  pulse 90; respiration audible as before. The
                                                  wound discharged a bloody serous fluid. At 6 P. M., respiration was difficult, and percussion in
                                                  the lower parts dull; respiration was not audible
                                                  on the posterior side. The finger was introduced
                                                  into the opening and a large amount of bloody
                                                  serum discharged; the patient felt somewhat
                                                  relieved. October 14th, weak; pulse 110;
                                                  discharges free and of a putrid smell;
                                                  crepitation. Percussion dull in lower part of left

                                                  Dover's powder of ten grains every three hours. The
                                                  patient continued to sink, and died <date type="death" when="1864-10-20">October 20th, 1864</date>, from exhaustion. At the autopsy, ten hours
                                                  afterward, both auricles, and the right ventricle
                                                  of the heart, were found to be filled with
                                                  fibrinous coagula. The pericardium contained a
                                                  small quantity of serum. The right lung was
                                                  collapsed and hepatized; the bronchi and their
                                                  ramifications were filled with matter. The ball
                                                  entered the inner margin of the middle lobe of the
                                                  right lung and emerged on the exterior surface of
                                                  the third lobe, slightly fractured the eighth rib,
                                                  and was found lying on the diaphragm. The pleur&#230;
                                                  were covered with lymph, and a spicula of the
                                                  second rib was found. There were a few small
                                                  tubercles at the apex of the left lung.  </p>
