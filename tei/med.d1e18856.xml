                                                  The integuments over the sacrum have sloughed
                                                  away. A large sinus, connecting with this, opens
                                                  in the right side of the perineum. He has a large
                                                  ulcer on his right foot. I opened a large abscess
                                                  in the back, which discharged a considerable
                                                  amount of unhealthy pus. His general health is
                                                  very poor; in fact he is a broken-down man. He
                                                  can walk a little with two canes, but is
                                                  incapacitated for performing any manual labor, and
                                                  permanently so. Much of the time he requires the
                                                  constant aid and attention of another person." </p>
