                    <p>To the Commissioners under the Act of Congress approved <date
                            when="1862-04-16">April 16th 1862</date>, entitled "An act for the
                        release of certain persons held to service or labor in the
                            <placeName>District of Columbia</placeName>:"</p>

                    <p>Your petitioner <persName>William Peters</persName> of <placeName>Georgetown
                            D.C.</placeName> by this his petition in writing represents and states
                        that he is a person loyal to the <placeName>United States</placeName>, who
                        at the time of the passage of the said Act of Congress, held a claim to
                        service and labor against a female person of African descent of the name of
                            <persName>Louisa Carter</persName>, for and during the life of said
                            <persName>Louisa Carter</persName>, and that by said Act of Congress
                        said <persName>Louisa Carter</persName> was discharged and freed of and from
                        all claim of your petitioner to such service or labor: that at the time of
                        said discharge said <persName>Louisa Carter</persName> was of the age of
                        sixteen years and of the personal description following namely: said
                            <persName>Louisa Carter</persName> is sixteen years of age, about five
                        feet high, of a dark brown color, not black although a real African, and
                        quite sound and healthy in every respect: that your petitioner acquired his
                        claim to the service or labor aforesaid of said <persName>Louisa
                            Carter</persName>, by purchasing her of <persName>Leonard
                            Boarman</persName> of <placeName>Charles County Maryland</placeName> in
                        the year <date when="1854">Eighteen Hundred and Fifty four</date>, when she
                        was about Eight years, at and for the price of three hundred and
                        fifty-dollars,&#8212;that he has mislaid the bill of sale, but will obtain a
                        duplicate thereof and file it hereafter with this Board&#8212;that your
                        petitioner's claim to the service of labor of said <persName>Louisa
                            Carter</persName> was at the time of said discharge therefrom of the
                        value of One thousand dollars in money, she having always been sound and
                        healthy, and an excellent house-servant, and that he has no knowledge of any
                        moral, mental or physical infirmity or defect in her:</p>
                    <p>Your petitioner hereby declares that he bears true and faithful allegiance to
                        the Government of the <placeName>United States</placeName>, and that he has
                        not borne arms against the <placeName>United States</placeName>, and that he
                        has not borne arms against the <placeName>United States</placeName> in the
                        present rebellion, nor in any way given aid or comfort thereto: and also,
                        that he has not brought said <persName>Louisa Carter</persName> into the
                        said <placeName>District of Columbia</placeName> since the passage of said
                        Act of Congress: and that at the time of the passage thereof said
                            <persName>Louisa Carter</persName> had been, and was held to service or
                        labor therein under and by virtue of your petitioner's claim to such service
                        or labor.</p>
                    <p>Your petitioner further states and alleges that his said claim to the service
                        or labor of said <persName>Louisa Carter</persName> does not originate in or
                        by virtue of any transfer heretofore made by any person, who has in any
                        manner aided or sustained the present rebellion against the Government of
                        the <placeName>United States</placeName>.</p>
                    <p>Your petitioner

                        Your Petitioner prays the said Commissioners to investigate and determine the
                        validity of his said claim to the service or labor of said <persName>Louisa
                            Carter</persName>, herein before set forth, and if the same be found to
                        be valid&#8212;that they appraise and apportion the value thereof in money, and
                        report the same to the Secretary of the Treasury of the <placeName>United
