                                        as a case of remittent fever. Next day his eyes were bright,
                                        cheeks slightly flushed, pulse 74 and regular, skin
                                        somewhat above the natural temperature, tongue moist,
                                        fissured and faintly coated yellow, appetite good; he had a
                                        slight cough, pain in the back and limbs, relaxed bowels,
                                        tympanites and general abdominal tenderness, marked in the
                                        right iliac region. Two rose-colored spots were discovered
                                        on the 21st, the symptoms otherwise remaining as stated.
                                        Twelve grains of quinine and two of opium were given daily
                                        in divided doses, with Dover's powder at night. On the 24th
                                        the skin became moist. Next day he was wakeful, his eyes
                                        dull and cheeks congested. Two drachms of sulphate of
                                        magnesia with one-twelfth of a grain of tartar emetic were

                                        night. After this he seemed to improve, his pulse, tongue
                                        and skin becoming natural and appetite good, he slept well,
