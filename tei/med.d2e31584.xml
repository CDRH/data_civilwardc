   <p><hi rend="initialcap">F</hi>IG. 236.&#8212;<name type="person" key="xxx">Lieutenant G. P. Deichler</name>, <name type="organization" key="xxx">Co. I, 69th Pennsylvania</name>, aged 22 years, was wounded by a conoidal musket ball, at <name type="BATTLE" key="79">Hatcher's Run, Virginia</name>, <date type="injury" when="1865-03-25">March 25, 1865</date>. The ball entered the right iliac region, and, passing through the ascending colon, made its exit a little to the left of the last dorsal vertebra. The patient was taken to the field hospital of the 2d division, Second Corps, in charge of <name type="person" key="xxx">Acting Staff Surgeon John Aiken</name>, and from thence to <name type="place">Armory Square Hospital</name>, at Washington, where he was admitted on <date type="transfer" when="1865-04-01">April 1st</date>, in an exhausted condition, with grave symptoms of peritonitis. There was a copious f&#230;cal discharge from both wounds. Appropriate dressings were applied; a fourth of a grain of sulphate of morphia was ordered to be given every second hour, and stimulants were directed.  On April 7th, sloughs separated from both wounds, and left a clean granulating surface. A large piece of sphacelated omentum was removed from the anterior wound. The opiate treatment was continued till April 27th, when there was a f&#230;cal evacuation by the anus, for the first time since the injury.  On June 12th, the discharge from the wounds was very slight. <name type="person" key="xxx">Acting Assistant Surgeon C. A. Leale</name>, who reported the foregoing facts, states further, that the edges of the wounds were now refreshed and approximated by adhesive strips. On <date type="hospitaldischarge" when="1865-08-10"><date type="photo" when="1865-08-10">August 10th</date></date>, the anterior wound was firmly healed. There was a small fistulous sinus at the posterior wound, discharging pus scantily. On this day, a photograph, from which the cut adjacent (<hi rend="initialcap">F</hi>IG. 53) is copied, was taken at the <name type="hospital" key="431">Army Medical Museum</name>, and the patient left the hospital for his home, at <name type="place">Lancaster, Pennsylvania</name>, in excellent general health. The fistula soon healed.  This officer was pensioned, and, in <date type="pension" when="1867-04">April, 1867</date>, <name type="person" key="xxx">Pension Examiner J. Severgood</name> was able to make a satisfactory report of his condition. Again in <date type="pension" when="1872-12">December, 1872</date>, the <name type="organization">Pension Office</name> received information of the continued good health of this officer, though the effects of his terrible wound, as well as his antecedents, naturally "disqualified him from manual labor."</p>
