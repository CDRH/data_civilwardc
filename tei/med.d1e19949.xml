A, 145th Pennsylvania Volunteers</name>, aged 24 years, was wounded at <name type="BATTLE" key="251">Fredericksburg, Virginia</name>, <date type="injury" when="1862-12-13">December 13th, 1862</date>; the ball entered the integuments at
                                                  the middle third, external edge of the scapula,
                                                  passed through the axilla, and lodged in front,
                                                  just below the insertion of the pectoralis minor.
                                                  He was carried to the field hospital, where the
                                                  ball was removed <date type="operation" when="1862-12-13">a few hours after</date> the reception
                                                  of the injury. Simple dressings were applied. On
                                                                <date type="transfer" when="1862-12-17">the 17th</date>, he was transferred to <name type="hospital" key="173">Harewood Hospital</name>, Washington. The case progressed well until <date type="operation" when="1862-12-23">the 23d</date>, when h&#230;morrhage to the amount of about six
                                                  ounces occurred from the posterior wound. The
                                                  wound was enlarged and the bleeding vessel
                                                  searched for, but it could not be found, although
                                                  it was supposed to be the suprascapular artery, as
                                                  pressure below the clavicle arrested the
                                                  h&#230;morrhage. The edge of the scapula was denuded
                                                  and rough for about one inch. The axillary artery
                                                  was ligated immediately after its emergence from
                                                  beneath the clavicle and the incision brought
                                                  together by adhesive strips. December 24th: Some
                                                  febrile disturbance. A diaphoretic was
                                                  administered, and milk diet ordered. 25th: Nervous
                                                  delirium; stimulants, with morphia, beef tea and
                                                  chicken diet. 26th: The delirium has subsided. On
                                                  the 27th, he refused to take the stimulants and
                                                  morphia, and the delirium returned. It was with
                                                  the greatest difficulty that nourishment could be
                                                  administered to him, as he closed his teeth and
                                                  rejected everything. He continued in this
                                                  condition until the 29th, when a capillary
                                                  h&#230;morrhage occurred to the amount of about one
                                                  ounce from the posterior wound. Compress and
                                                  bandage were applied, which entirely arrested it.
                                                  He would occasionally take a spoonful of milk
                                                  punch with a small quantity of morphia in it.
                                                  Death resulted on the night of <date type="death" when="1862-12-29">December 29th, 1862</date>. The ligatures had not come away. The wound
                                                  of incision had suppurated freely but there was no
                                                  attempt at union. <name type="person" key="156">Surgeon Thomas Antisell</name>, <name type="organization" key="132">U. S. V.</name>, reports the case. </p>
