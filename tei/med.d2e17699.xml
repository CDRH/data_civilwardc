      Ellis</name>, <name type="organization" key="491">Co. D, 61st Pennsylvania</name>, aged 23
     years, was wounded in the left leg, at <name type="BATTLE" key="10">Chancellorsville</name>, <date type="injury" when="1863-05-03">May 3, 1863</date>, and entered <name

      type="person" key="200">Assistant Surgeon W. Thomson</name>, <name type="organization"
      key="190">U. S. A.</name>, reported: "This officer suffered a fracture of the tibia near its
     middle by a ball, which entered posteriorly at the gastrocnemius muscle, and was retained. The
     fracture united without exfoliation, necrosis, or even free suppuration. The leg was placed in
     a bran box and dressed with cold-water applications. The patient suffered from severe catarrh,
     which yielded to treatment. There was also hyper&#230;sthesia of the foot, for which, <date type="operation" when="1863-06">before
     the patient left on furlough</date> in <date type="furlough" when="1863-06">June</date>, I made an
     incision in search of the ball and disturbed the cicatrix with good effect, relieving the
     nervous irritation of the foot. When the patient returned from furlough, <date type="furlough" when="1863-09-01">September 1st</date>, he was
     ordered to report to <name type="person" key="1235">Surgeon M. Clymer</name>, <name
      type="organization" key="132">U. S. V.</name>, for treatment, and I lost sight of him. His
     recovery was good, but the leg was yet feeble and contracted, owing to want of passive motion
     while at his home." <name type="person" key="1234">Captain Ellis</name> resigned <date type="duty" when="1864-01-01">January 1, 1864</date>, and was commissioned in the

     served until <date type="servicedischarge" when="1866-03-13">March 13, 1866</date>, when he was mustered out and
     pensioned. <name type="person" key="xx">Examining Surgeon G. Urquhart</name>, of <name

     bent and shortened; foot swollen and tender, and muscles shrunken above the ankle. He suffers
     extreme pain in the leg and is unable to bear much weight upon it; general health not good."
     The pensioner was paid <date type="pension" when="1880-09-04">September 4, 1880</date>. </p>
