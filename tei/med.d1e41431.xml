The bronchial glands were enlarged, black and softened. The pericardium contained an ounce of serum. The heart was normal. The omentum was congested. The liver was pale and flabby, apparently in a state of fatty degeneration; the gall-bladder contained half an ounce of bile. The spleen was normal in size, but softened. The mesenteric glands were enlarged and filled with softened tubercle. The mucous membrane of the small intestine was thickened and rough. [&#63;] There were several small ulcers in Peyer's glands. The colon was normal. The kidneys were pale and soft; on examination with the microscope they were found to be in a state of fatty degeneration; the bladder contained six ounces of urine.</p>
