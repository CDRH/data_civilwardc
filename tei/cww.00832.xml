                        which your Petitioner feels loth to fix in money, for reasons of mutual good
                        will &#38; services, she would beg leave to state; that within the last five
                        or six years, persons have expressed their readiness to pay as high as
                        $1400.; offers or suggestions, which, for the reasons stated, were neglected
                        or refused. <persName>Maria</persName> is healthy, robust, active, quick in mind and body, very
                        apt &#38; smart, &#38; does everything well she is put to or undertakes.
                        Your petitioner knows of no infirmities or defects of said person which
                        impair the value of Petitioner's claim to such service or labor, and that
                        she believes none other to exist.</seg></p>

                <p>Your petitioner hereby declares that <seg type="handwritten">she</seg> bears true and faithful allegiance
                    to the Government of the United States, and that <seg type="handwritten">she</seg> has not borne arms against the

                    thereto.</p>

                <p>And your petitioner further states and alleges, that <seg type="handwritten">she</seg> has not brought said <seg type="handwritten"><persName>Maria</persName></seg> into the District
                    of Columbia since the passage of said act of Congress; and that, at the time of
                    the passage thereof, said <seg type="handwritten"><persName>Maria</persName></seg> was held to service or labor therein
                    under and by virtue of your petitioner's claim to such service or labor.</p>

                <p>Your petitioner further states and alleges, that <seg type="handwritten">her</seg> said claim to the service or labor
                    of said <seg type="handwritten"><persName>Maria Foreman</persName></seg> does not
                    originate in or by virtue of any transfer heretofore made by any person who has
                    in any manner aided or sustained the present rebellion against the Government of
                    the United States.</p>

                <p>And your petitioner prays the said Commissioners to investigate and determine the
                    validity of <seg type="handwritten">her</seg> said
                    claim to the service or labor of said <seg type="handwritten"><persName>Maria Foreman</persName></seg> herein above set forth; and if the
                    same be found to be valid, that they appraise and apportion the value of said
                    claim in money, and report the same to the Secretary of the Treasury of the
