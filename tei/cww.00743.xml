                <p>That your petitioner's claim to the service or labor of said

                <p>Your petitioner avers that the said <persName>Gabriel</persName> is a healthy
                    strong and active person that for the last ten years said

                        <persName>Pierce</persName> at his nursery and fruit garden in said District
                    and that your petitioner knows of no moral mental or bodily infirmities, or
                    defects, which can impair the value of your petitioner's claim to such service
                    or labor of said <persName>Gabriel</persName>.</p>

                <p>Your Petitioner hereby declares that she bears true and faithful allegiance to
                    the government of the <placeName>United States</placeName>, and that she has not
                    borne arms against the <placeName>United States</placeName> in the present
                    rebellion, nor in any way given aid or comfort thereto.</p>

                <p>And your petitioner further states and avers that she has not brought said
                        <persName>Gabriel</persName> into the <placeName>District of
                        Columbia</placeName> since the passage of said act of Congress, and that at
                    the time of the passage thereof, said <persName>Gabriel</persName> was held to
                    service or labor therein, under and by virtue of your petitioner's claim to such
                    service or labor.</p>

                <p>Your petitioner further states and avers that her said claim to the service or
                    labor <pb xml:id="leaf002r" facs="cww.00743.004.jpg"/> of said
                        <persName>Gabriel</persName> does not originate in or by virtue of any
                    transfer heretofore made by any person who has in any manner aided or sustained
                    the present rebellion against the government of the <placeName>United
                        States</placeName>.</p>

                <p>And your petitioner prays the said Commissioners to investigate and determine the
                    validity of her said claim to the service or labor of said
                        <persName>Gabriel</persName>, and if the same be found valid that they
                    appraise and apportion the value of said claim in money and report the same to
                    the Secretary of the Treasury of the <placeName>United States</placeName> in
                    conformity to the provisions of said act of Congress.</p>
