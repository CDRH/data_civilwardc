Y.</name>, was admitted <date type="admit" when="1861-09-02">Sept. 2, 1861</date>, with typhoid fever.  During convalescence he took cold, on <date type="injury" when="1861-09-20">the 20th</date>, while sleeping in
                                        the hospital garden, his throat at once swelling and
                                        becoming sore.  On October 1 a diphtheritic membrane was
                                        observed in the upper part of the pharynx, but there was
                                        little constitutional disturbance. A solution of nitrate of
                                        silver, forty grains to an ounce of water, was used locally,
                                        with chlorate of potash and tincture of iron for internal
                                        use.  On the 4th the membrane appeared in irregular patches
                                        about the palate and tonsils, interfering but little with
                                        swallowing, although the parts were very tender; the patient
                                        was an&#230;mic.  On the 5th a fly-blister was applied to each
                                        side of the neck.  On the 15th the false membranes were
                                        disappearing.&#8212;<hi rend="italic">Hospital, <name type="place">Alexandria, Va.</name></hi> </p>
