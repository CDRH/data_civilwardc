                                                        1861</date>, having been taken sick about <date type="injury" when="1861-09-20">a week before</date> with
                                        chills and fever, for which quinine and alteratives had been
                                        administered. On admission he was weak, had anorexia and
                                        headache, but his skin was natural, tongue moist and
                                        slightly coated, pulse 72 and bowels quiet. Up to October 5
                                        there was no marked change in the patient's condition; the
                                        coating of the tongue became somewhat thickened; the skin
                                        was dry, hot on the 3d, perspiring on the 4th; the bowels
                                        were quiet or moved once daily, and there was some
                                        tenderness in the right iliac region; the headache continued
                                        and there was slight cough. On the 6th the patient vomited
                                        some dark-colored matters. On the 7th he was restless for
                                        the first time since admission; the bowels were moved four
                                        times and the tongue was moist, red at the tip and edges and
                                        dark-brown at the centre and base. On the 8th he was
                                        delirious; pulse 90 and quick; skin hot and dry, showing a
                                        few rose-spots, disappearing on pressure, and mingled with
                                        profuse eruption (character not stated); tongue dry, flabby,
                                        red at the tip and edges, coated brown in the centre;
                                        appetite very good; he had one stool, some tympanites and
                                        slight gurgling in the right iliac region. No change was
                                        manifested save increasing <choice><orig>dulness</orig><reg>dullness</reg></choice> of mind and prostration
                                        until the 13th, when the tongue became slightly moist and
                                        the delirium lessened. During this period the teeth were
                                        covered with sordes and the mouth filled with tenacious
                                        mucus. On the 14th the parotids became swollen. Next day the
                                        pulse was 120 and feeble and the bowels quiet but tender and
                                        distended; the patient, nevertheless, when aroused from his
                                        low delirium, expressed himself as feeling quite well. The
                                        tongue became moist and its coating yellowish-white on the
                                        16th, and on the following day the patient was more
                                        rational; the eruption was present up to this date. A sharp
                                        diarrh&#339;a of seven stools occurred on the 18th and
                                        the pulse reached 140. A blister was applied to the abdomen.
                                        On the 19th vibices appeared; the tongue could not be
                                        protruded on account of the parotid swelling; the bowels
                                        were moved once only, but they were generally tender and
                                        much meteorized. Death took place on <date type="death"
