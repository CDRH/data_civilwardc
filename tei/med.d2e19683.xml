     <name type="person" key="72">Surgeon G. L. Pancoast</name>, <name type="organization" key="132"

     type="transfer" when="1864-06-15">June 15th</date>, from the field hospital. His injury
    consisted of a compound comminuted fracture of the right tibia, for which amputation was
    performed at the upper third on <date type="operation" when="1864-06-20">June 20th</date>. The
    operation was done by the flap method and chloroform was used as the an&#230;sthetic, the
    patient's general condition being excellent. After two days of suffering the patient's progress
    of recovery was rapid. Cold-water dressings were applied." A part of the amputated tibia (<hi

    necrosis, was contributed by <name type="person" key="72">the operator</name> and is represented
    in the wood-cut (<hi rend="initialcap">F</hi>IG. 296). The patient was subsequently transferred
    to <name type="hospital" key="428">Judiciary Square Hospital</name>, where, after being

     Co.</name>, he was discharged from service <date type="servicedischarge" when="1865-05-04">May

    continuing "all right." </p>
