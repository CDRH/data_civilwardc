            Diagnosis&#8212;typhoid fever. The pulse was 46, skin cool and moist, left side
            tender and dull, respiration short, decubitus on the sound side, tongue smooth, nearly
            dry, bowels constipated and tender in both iliac regions. Two grains of calomel and
            one-fourth grain of morphia were prescribed. Next day the pain was less sharp, the
            pr&#230;cordia seemed elevated and the sounds of the heart were obscured. In the
            evening the patient was drowsy, pulse 50 and irregular, skin natural, tongue slightly
            coated gray posteriorly, red at the tip. Calomel in two-grain doses with opium was given
            every two hours. On the 20th there was acute tenderness in both iliac regions but the
            bowels continued constipated. On the 21st the breath became fetid, and on the following
            day the gums were swollen and tender. The mercurial was omitted. On the 24th chlorate of
            potash was given on account of the salivation. The patient was walking about and had a
            good appetite on the 30th, and was doing light duty in the ward on October 3. He was
            returned to duty on <date type="duty" when="1861-10-17">the 17th</date>. </p>
