          S——</name>, <name type="organization" key="xxx">Co. H, 151st New York
          Volunteers</name>, aged 26 years, was admitted to the <name type="hospital" key="189">3d
          division hospital</name>, <name type="place">Alexandria</name>, <date type="admit" when="1863-12-04">December 4th, 1863</date>, with a gunshot penetrating wound of the left
        chest, received at <name type="battle" key="xxx">Locust Grove, Virginia</name>, <date type="injury" when="1863-11-27">November 27th</date>. A conical ball entered two inches
        below the coracoid process, passed inward and downward and lodged in the posterior portion
        of the lower lobe of the left lung. When admitted, there was slight constitutional
        disturbance, diminished respiration of apex of left lung, slight cough, and white frothy
        expectorations. Sedatives, anodynes, and stimulants were administered, with nourishing diet.
        On the next day, the patient was able to walk about the ward and seemed quite comfortable.
        Nothing occurred to attract particular attention until <date type="injury" when="1864-01-03">January 3d</date>, when the expectoration was noticed to be very offensive; respiration
        scarcely perceptible in the left lung; pulse very weak. January 8th, 1864, breathing
        labored, complete <choice>
          <orig>dulness</orig>
          <reg>dullness</reg>
        </choice> of left side extending to right of sternum. He gradually sank, and died on <date type="death" when="1864-01-10">January 10th, 1864</date>. Necropsy: Left pleural cavity
        filled with serum; lung compressed in small space. Pericardium was much distended with
        fluid, amounting to twelve ounces, and the second rib comminuted. The ball had struck the
        sternum at the articulation of the second rib, which was denuded and rough. The whole
        surface of the pericardium was covered with coagulated lymph having the appearance of tripe.
        The ball was found in the posterior portion of the lower lobe of the right lung; the liver
        was enlarged and soft. A preparation of a portion of the left lung, with the missile lodged
        just beneath its surface, is represented in the wood-cut (<hi rend="initialcap">F</hi>IG.
        285). The lung has been laid open to display the lodgement of the ball. Even the rings on
        the base of the projectile are imprinted on the cheesy tissue. The specimen was contributed,
        with a history of the case, by <name type="person">Acting Assistant Surgeon W. G.
          Elliott</name>. </p>
