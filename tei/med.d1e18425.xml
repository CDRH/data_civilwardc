                                                  cartilage, passing through the trachea, and lodged

                                                  still in the neck. He was, on <date type="admit" when="1862-10-06">October 6th</date>,

                                                  be swallowed only with difficulty; air passed
                                                  through the wound in respiration. On October 16th,
                                                  the wound discharged slightly, but healthy; on

                                                  laboring under anorexia. On <date type="injury" when="1862-10-23">October 23d</date>,
                                                  inflammation, erysipelatous in character, was
                                                  increasing, and, on the 26th, extended over the
                                                  entire head and face. November 2d, the patient was
                                                  improving, and, on the 6th, the wounds were
