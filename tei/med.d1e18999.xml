                                                  Cavalry</name>, aged 18 years, of sound constitution, was
                                                  hit in the loins by a conoidal musket ball, in an

                                                  division, Cavalry Corps, and his wound was
                                                  examined and dressed by <name type="person">Surgeon W. H. Rulison</name>, <name type="organization">9th

                                                  to the left of the spinous process of the second
                                                  lumbar vertebra, passed transversely to the right,
                                                  inclining forward through the lumbar muscles, and
                                                  emerged five inches from the median line. There
                                                  was complete paraplegia. The catheter was required
                                                  for three days, and there was obstinate
                                                  constipation. On <date type="transfer" when="1864-06-02">June 2d</date>, the paralysis began to
                                                  disappear, and the patient was sent to <name type="place" key="#Washington">Washington</name>,
                                                                and entered <name type="hospital" key="175">Stanton Hospital</name>, under the immediate
                                                                charge of <name type="person" key="459">Assistant Surgeon G. A. Mursick</name>, <name type="organization" key="132">U. S. V.</name> His general condition was good; but there was
                                                  still partial paraplegia. He complained of pain in
                                                  the right hip, and the paralysis was most marked
                                                  on that side. On <date type="operation" when="1864-06-19">June 19th</date>, Dr. Mursick removed a
                                                  small detached fragment of the spinous process of
                                                  the second lumbar. On <date type="operation" when="1864-07-12">July 12th</date>, he removed
                                                  another fragment. At this date, the patient would
                                                  move about on crutches; he could move his lower
                                                  limbs freely in bed; but had difficulty in
                                                  standing upright. He complained of a queer
                                                  benumbed sensation in the light hip and thigh. On
                                                  July 21st, the exit wound was nearly healed; but
                                                  the entrance wound was sloughy. A permanganate of
                                                  potassa lotion was prescribed. On July 28th, the
                                                  wound was granulating finely, and the patient
                                                  could walk pretty well with the aid of a cane. On
                                                                <date type="furlough" when="1864-08-18">August 18th</date>, the wounds had healed, and, with the
                                                  exception of slight weakness of the lower
                                                  extremities, he was well. He was furloughed from
                                                  the hospital at this date, and failing to return,
                                                  was recorded as a deserter, <date type="desertion" when="1864-10-31">October 31st, 1864</date>.⃰
                                                  His name is not on the Pension List, nor have his heirs made application for pension.</p>
