    forwarded the specimen (<hi rend="initialcap">F</hi>IG. 275), with the following description of
    the injury: "The wound was produced by a musket ball, which passed through the leg near the
    ankle, shattering the lower third of the fibula in its course. Upon examination the operation of
    excision was thought advisable, and was performed, on <date type="operation" when="1864-08-29"
     >August 29th</date>, by <name type="person" key="884">Surgeon N. R. Moseley</name>, <name
     type="organization" key="132">U. S. V.</name>, who removed two and a half inches of the fibula
    near the ankle joint through an incision three and a half inches long. Ether and chloroform
    constituted the an&#230;sthetic." The patient was subsequently transferred to Webster Hospital,
     <name type="place">Manchester</name>, and on <date type="servicedischarge" when="1865-05-27"
     >May 27, 1865</date>, he was mustered out of service and pensioned. Various examining surgeons
    certified to the injury and operation, and <name type="person" key="xx">Dr. C. B.
    Pearson</name>, of <name type="place" key="xx">Spring Green, Wisconsin</name>, <date

    muscle has grown fast to the tibia so as to destroy action of the tendons," etc. Subsequent
    examiners corroborate the previous reports. The pensioner was paid <date type="pension"
