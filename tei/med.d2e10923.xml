      key="201">Assistant Surgeon W. F. Norris</name>, <name type="organization" key="190">U. S. A.</name>, reports, November 16th: It was found impossible to support the heavy posterior muscular flap; the
     sutures sloughed out, and there was a great gaping surface discharging profusely, but normal in
     appearance. The patient was very pallid. The stump was thoroughly supported by adhesive straps, and the best nutrients, with stimulants, were
     administered. 24th, there was slight tenderness along the femoral artery and slight enlargement
     of the inguinal glands. There was no vigorous effort at repair in the stump, which remained
     pale and flabby, and his general condition became worse daily. December 4th, there were
     well-marked chills with fever in the evening, pulse 120 and feeble, respiration hurried,
     sweating, and nausea. These symptoms became hourly worse; his pulse became countless, his
     respiration sighing and very rapid, his face pinched and anxious; occasional vomits of a green
     <choice><orig>bilous</orig><reg>bilious</reg></choice> matter: he finally died, on <date type="death" when="1863-12-07">December 7th</date>, at
     4 o'clock P. M., of py&#230;mia. Autopsy sixteen hours after death. <name type="person"
      key="200">Assistant Surgeon W. Thomson</name>, <name type="organization" key="190">U. S. A.</name>, records: "The most careful examination failed to find a trace of inflammation or
     coagulation in the blood-vessels. The soft tissues of the stump were perfectly normal. There were found in the
     thoracic cavity the usual traces of py&#230;mia. The lungs anteriorly were pale, posteriorly
     they were both coated over the lower lobes with recent yellow and soft ill-looking lymph. There
     was no considerable effusion or adhesions; no traces of a frank pleuritis, but of a local
     asthenic inflammation were found. Both lungs were congested, hardened, and dark in color
     posteriorly, and in the left there were several small yellowish-white spaces, apparently
     abscesses.   &#42;   &#42;   The other organs, except the cerebro-spinal, were examined and found normal except the spleen, which was slightly hardened and
     congested. No trace of <choice><orig>embolia</orig><reg>emboli</reg></choice> was found in the lungs, nor was death caused by the secondary
     changes there produced. The destruction of pulmonary tissue had not progressed sufficiently.
     There must have been the absorption, by the veins most probably, from this medullary and
     cancellated portion of the femur, of a material soluble in the fluids of the blood, and
     produced, in the cadaveric changes that took place in the organic matter&#8212;dead, but confined in
     this cancellated bone. This caused the fatal toxic&#230;mia which overpowers the nervous
     system, and may have also caused those local changes found in the posterior portions of both
     lungs. It seems strongly probable that it is due to blood poisoning, introduced by the veins,
     since all cases of py&#230;mia exhibit pathological changes in the lungs, where the venous
     blood becomes distributed to thin delicate structures before being depurated by exposure to the
     atmosphere. The case was about to be relinquished as incomprehensible, when it was proposed by
      <name type="person" key="201">Dr. Norris</name> to saw the femur from its head to its
     extremity longitudinally, and thus expose its medullary canal. A small quantity of apparently
     healthy pus had been found between the periosteum and the shaft two inches from the sawn end,
     and there were a few osteophytes clinging to the bone at that point. When, however, the bone
     had been separated in its long diameter, its medullary canal presented the traces of
     pathological action. This canal and the cancellated structure extending past the trochanters to
     a point half way through the head were found filled with a yellowish-green substance,
     intolerably fetid, and resembling, more than anything else, the debris of hospital gangrene.
     The bone was sent at once to <name type="hospital" key="431">the Museum</name> and portrayed in
     colors. No pus was found in this bone, and, under the microscope, nothing but debris. The
     connective tissue seemed to have perished <hi rend="italic">en masse</hi>. In <hi
      rend="initialcap">P</hi>LATE XXXII, opposite, the diseased stump of the femur is represented,
     and <hi rend="initialcap">P</hi>LATE XXXI, opp. p. 228, exhibits the gangrenous condition of
     the medullary canal.</p>
