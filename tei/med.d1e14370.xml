                            D, 127th Pennsylvania Volunteers</name>, aged 22 years, was wounded at the battle of <name type="BATTLE" key="xx">Fredericksburg, Virginia</name>,
                        <date type="injury" when="1863-05-01">May 1, 1863</date>, by a spherical
                    case-shot which penetrated the right parietal bone near the junction of the
                    sagittal and coronal sutures.  On the morning of <date type="admit"
                        when="1863-05-06">the 6th</date>, he was conveyed by steamer to <name type="place" key="#Washington">Washington</name>, and
                    was admitted to the <name type="hospital" key="175">Stanton Hospital</name>, in a state of
                    unconsciousness, suffering from the shock of injury; his pulse was one hundred
                    and sixty and very feeble. By the afternoon of that day he had rallied
                    considerably, though he still remained insensible. No paralysis of any part of
                    the body could be detected. He lay upon his back, apparently sleeping, his
                    respiration being perfectly natural. During the examination of the pupils, which
                    were found somewhat contracted, though still symmetrical, he exhibited
                    manifestations of consciousness by offering some resistance. A probe was readily
                    passed a considerable distance along the track of the missile into the brain
                    substance. Very little h&#230;morrhage from the wound occurred. The patient swallowed
                    without difficulty and passed his urine involuntarily. After shaving the head a
                    bag of ice was applied; a stimulating injection was then employed, which acted
                    well, and nutriment was given in the form of beef tea.  The next morning the
                    pulse was one hundred and fourteen and somewhat stronger; the pupils were
                    natural in size, and contracted readily under the action of light. He readily
                    flexed and extended his legs, raised his hands to his head, rubbed his eyes,
                    which he kept closed, stretched and yawned like one awaking from a sound sleep,
                    and endeavored to remove the ice bag. He manifested dislike to beef tea and
                    seemed to recognize the sound of his name when addressed, but took no notice of
                    surrounding objects. The enema was repeated.  On the morning of the 9th, the
                    pulse had risen to one hundred and thirty, with further dilatation of the right
                    pupil. Half grain doses of calomel, with one-eighth grain of ipecac, were now
                    given every eighth hour.  On the 10th, stupor became profound, with paralysis of
                    the right buccinator muscle. No other face muscles were involved and there were
                    no convulsions or paralysis. On the 11th there was full dilatation of the right
                    pupil, the left remaining natural. The respiration, still without stertor, was
                    greatly increased in frequency, the diaphragm assisting but little in the
                    breathing. The power of deglutition was lost and the right arm was partially
                    paralyzed.  The enema was repeated but the patient continued to sink, and died at
                    eight P. M. on the <date type="death" when="1863-05-11">11th of May</date>.  At
                    the autopsy, some fragments of bone were found at the wound of entrance. On
                    removing the calvaria, a large quantity of serum, slightly tinged with blood,
                    escaped from the cavity. The missile had passed downward, backward, and to the
                    left side, into the left cerebral hemisphere. Several small pieces of bone, a
                    piece of scalp, and some hair, were distributed along the track, around which,
                    for the distance of half an inch, the brain was softened by inflammation. A
                    large clot of blood lay along the right side of the falx cerebri.  The
                    pathological specimen, No. 1137, Sect. I, A. M. M., showing five fragments of
                    bone, with a round bullet, removed at the autopsy, was contributed, with the
