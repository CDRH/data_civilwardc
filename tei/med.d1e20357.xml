        <hi rend="initialcap">F</hi>IG. xxx.&#8212;<name type="person" key="xxx">Private William
          B&#8212;&#8212;</name>, <name type="organization" key="xxx">Co. F, 6th Wisconsin
          Volunteers</name>, aged 18 years, was wounded in the first battle in which his regiment
        participated, at <name type="place">Gainesville</name>, <date type="injury"
          when="1862-08-28">August 28th, 1862</date>, the first of the series of engagements
        included under the title of the <name type="BATTLE" key="127">Second Battle of Bull
          Run</name>. He was shot through the right chest, and was left upon the field for several
        hours, but was finally provided with shelter at a field station of the First Army Corps.
        There was not much bleeding; but a frequent painful cough, with bloody sputa, and
        dyspn&#339;a, and anxiety, and a quick small pulse. Occasional stimulants, with small
        anodynes, and cooling drinks, constituted the general treatment, and the local treatment
        consisted in covering the orifices of the wounds with compresses secured by adhesive strips.
        On <date type="transfer" when="1862-09-02">September 2d</date>, he was placed in an
        ambulance train, and, after a weary journey, over rough roads, of over thirty miles, he was
        admitted to <name type="hospital" key="170">College Hospital, Georgetown</name>, <date
          type="admit" when="1862-09-06">September 6th, 1862</date>, according to the memorandum of
          <name type="person" key="xxx">Acting Assistant Surgeon J. Morris Brown</name>, &#34;with a
        perforating gunshot wound of the thoracic cavity; the missile entered on the right side,
        between the first and second ribs, about one and a half inches from the costal cartilages,
        passed downward and backward, perforated the right lung, and emerged at the angle of the
        fifth rib, which it comminuted, besides chipping the sixth. There was effusion in the right
        pleura; sonorous rales; exaggerated breathing; he also spat blood.&#34; The prescription
        book of the hospital is the only guide to the progress of the case during the six weeks
        which elapsed before its fatal termination. Death resulted on <date type="death"
          when="1862-10-21">October 21st, 1862</date>. The necropsy revealed the track of the ball.
        The wood-cut (<hi rend="initialcap">F</hi>IG. 303) represents a preparation of the right
        lung and of six ribs of the same side. The lung is collapsed and solidified and the pleura
        intensely thickened after inflammation, the pleura pulmonalis being about two and a half
        lines in thickness. There is a corresponding thickening of the costal membrane. The specimen
        was contributed, with a brief note of the case, by <name type="person" key="xxx">Acting
          Assistant Surgeon G. K. Smith</name>. </p>
