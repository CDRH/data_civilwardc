The wound was followed by erysipelas, etc. His fingers are partially stiffened, but they are gradually improving," etc.  The <name type="organization" key="xxx">Zanesville Examining Board</name> reported, <date type="pension" when="1873-09-05">September 5, 1873</date>: " *   *   *   The fracture of the radius was superficial, that of the ulna was complete; the flexor tendons wounded, also the internal cutaneous nerve. The skin is numb on the inner side of the forearm, and there is adhesion of tendons at seat of wound to skin and fascia. Hence he can only flex the fingers to one-half, the adhesions limiting the further flexion of them, and from this cause the power of the forearm and hand is impaired."  The pensioner was paid <date type="pension" when="1875-09-04">Sept. 4, 1875</date>.</p>
