Diagnosis, dropsy.  Transferred to <name type="place">Philadelphia, Pennsylvania</name>, <date type="transfer" when="1864-05-14">May 14th</date>. Admitted to Mower hospital, <name type="place">Philadelphia</name>, <date type="admit" when="1864-05-15">May 15th</date>.  Diagnosis, general debility.  Transferred, <date type="transfer" when="1865-02-11">February 11, 1865</date>. Admitted to Turner's Lane hospital, <name type="person" key="xxx">Surgeon R. A. Christian</name>, <name type="organization" key="132">U. S. V.</name>, in charge, <date type="admit" when="1865-02-11">February 11th</date>.  Diagnosis, partial paraplegia.  The case-book of the latter hospital states that this man enlisted <date type="enlist" when="1862-02-13">February 13, 1862</date>; was first taken with diarrh&#339;a at <name type="place">Occoquan creek, Virginia</name>; it continued five months. He was furloughed, for sixty days <date type="furlough" when="1863-11">about two months after being taken ill</date>, but was not well enough to return to his regiment when the furlough expired. While on furlough the diarrh&#339;a ceased, but soon after his lower extremities, especially the left, became partially paralyzed.  He went to Washington about six months after he received his furlough, and was admitted to <name type="hospital" key="162">Douglas hospital</name> as above stated. At present his lower limbs are so feeble that he can only walk with crutches. Muscular contractility and sensation appear to be good in both limbs, but the left leg is feeble and three-quarters of an inch smaller round the calf than the other. His general health is apparently good.  This man was discharged from the hospital by reason of expiration of term of service, <date type="servicedischarge" when="1865-03-03"><date type="hospitaldischarge" when="1865-03-03">March 3, 1865</date></date>. His condition at that time was much improved.</p>
