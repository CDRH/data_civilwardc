      (<hi rend="italic">Contrib. Photo's</hi>, S. G. O., Vol. VIII, p. 21), with the following
     history: "The patient was admitted to <name type="hospital" key="173">Harewood Hospital</name>,
      <date type="admit" when="1865-04-05">April 5th</date>, suffering from amputation at the left
     knee joint, which was performed on the field by the antero-posterior flap method, for shot
     wound of the leg involving injury to the knee joint. The operator and the extent of the injury
     were unknown. At the time of admission the condition of the stump and the constitutional state
     of the patient were tolerably good. The parts subsequently became gangrenous; but by timely application of escharotics, and by supporting treatment throughout,
     the patient did well and made fair progress in his recovery. A part of the femur was removed
     with the dressing forceps." The patient subsequently passed through <name type="hospital" key="176">Lincoln</name> and <name type="hospital" key="171">Armory Square Hospital</name>s, and on <date type="servicedischarge" when="1865-09-02">September 2, 1865</date>, he was discharged from service,
     and furnished with an artificial limb by the <name type="organization" key="450">Jewett Patent
      Leg Company</name>. The pensioner was paid <date type="pension" when="1879-12-04">December 4, 1879</date>. In his application for
     commutation he represented the stump as being in a sound condition. </p>
