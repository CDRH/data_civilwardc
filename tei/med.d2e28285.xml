      Brown</name>, <name type="organization" key="95">Co. C, 22d Massachusetts</name>, aged 23
     years, was admitted into <name type="hospital" key="172">Emory Hospital</name>, Washington,
      <date type="admit" when="1864-05-13">May 13, 1864</date>, with gunshot wounds of the thigh,
     leg, and neck, received at the battle of <name type="BATTLE" key="12">the Wilderness</name>,
      <date type="injury" when="1864-05-07">May 7, 1864</date>.  The thigh had been amputated on the field on <date type="operation" when="1864-05-07">May 7th</date>, in the lower third, by lateral flaps. A
     ball had entered the neck below the angle of the jaw, passed through the larynx, and lodged
     near where the carotid crosses the omo-hyoid muscles. On <date type="operation" when="1864-05-16">May 16th</date> the ball was extracted from
     its position against the carotid by an incision one and a half inches long, one inch below the
     mastoid process of the temporal bone, by <name type="person" key="880">Acting Assistant Surgeon
      W. H. Ensign</name>, <name type="organization" key="190">U. S. A.</name> At this date the
     thigh was healing kindly by first intention. The wound of the neck had an extraordinary
     appearance. The patient's constitution was slender but not much impaired. Some trouble in
     swallowing and breathing; cheerful, sleeps well, shows little signs of distress; pulse 90,
     bowels regular. No medicine given; but good liquid diet with local water dressings. Food has to
     be administered with a stomach pump. On <date type="death" when="1864-05-17">May 17th</date>
     h&#230;morrhage to the amount of one quart occurred from the internal jugular vein. Air was
     supposed to have passed through the vein into the heart. A <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi>
     examination showed the cause of h&#230;morrhage to be ulceration of the anterior surface of the
     internal jugular vein. The case is reported by <name type="person" key="884">Surgeon N. R.
      Moseley</name>, <name type="organization" key="132">U. S. V.</name></p>
