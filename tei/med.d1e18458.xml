                                                  right primitive carotid artery, and emerged near
                                                  the inferior border of the scapula on the left
                                                  side. He was admitted, on <date type="admit" when="1862-08">the next day,</date> to the
                                                                  <name type="hospital">Presbyterian Church Hospital</name>, <name type="place">Georgetown, D. C.</name>
                                                  The patient was somewhat exhausted when admitted,
                                                  but rallied under the use of stimulants.
                                                  Respiration was easy. Cold water dressings were
                                                  applied and anodynes given. During the night the
                                                  patient was extremely restless, continually
                                                  calling for water, and wishing to have his
                                                  position changed. The pulse was full and bounding.
                                                  There was paralysis of the upper and lower
                                                  extremities, consequent upon the severing of some
                                                  of the nerves involved in the wound. There was
                                                  also paralysis of the sphincters of the bladder
                                                  and rectum, the f&#230;ces and urine being voided
                                                  involuntarily. Great irritability of the stomach
                                                  was a constant symptom, it being impossible for
                                                  the patient to retain food or medicine for more
                                                  than fifteen minutes. Involuntary emissions of
                                                  semen occurred nearly every two hours. The patient
                                                  finally became so noisy and troublesome that it
                                                  was necessary to have him isolated. He continued
                                                  in this condition until September 16th, when he
                                                  began to sink, and died on <date type="death" when="1862-09-20">September 20th,
