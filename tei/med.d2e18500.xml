     incision two or three inches below the knee. <date type="operation" when="1864-05-20">Three days afterwards</date> three h&#230;morrhages occurred from the posterior tibial artery, amounting to one, three, and ten ounces
     respectively, and necessitating ligation of the femoral artery, which was performed below the
     profunda in Scarpa's space by <name type="person" key="201">Assistant Surgeon W. F.
      Norris</name>, <name type="organization" key="190">U. S. A.</name> Ether was used as the
     an&#230;sthetic. On the following day there was venous h&#230;morrhage to the amount of four
     ounces. A further loss of eight ounces of blood took place on May 25th, and of one and a half
     ounces the next day. Four more attacks followed on June 1st, each causing the loss of one-half
     ounce to an ounce of blood, and being checked by compression over the femoral where it emerges
     from the pelvis. Death resulted from exhaustion, <date type="death" when="1864-06-03">June 3,
      1864</date>. At the <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> examination the ligature was found to have nearly sloughed
     through; clot below, but none above it." </p>
