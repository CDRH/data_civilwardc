     <name type="person" key="1369">Acting Assistant Surgeon Z. P. Dennler</name>. Chloroform and

     stimulants, etc., were administered. Subsequently the patient passed through various hospitals,
     and on <date type="servicedischarge" when="1866-02-02">February 2, 1866</date>, he was discharged from
     service and pensioned.  He was paid <date type="pension" when="1874-06-04">June 4, 1874</date>, since when he has not been heard from.</p>
