    <hi rend="initialcap">C</hi>ASE 26.&#8212;<name type="person" key="875">Corporal H.
     Schatt</name>, <name type="organization" key="175">Co. H, 64th New York</name>, aged 30 years,
    was wounded at <name type="BATTLE" key="255">Hatcher's Run</name>, <date type="injury"
     when="1865-03-25">March 25, 1865</date>, and was admitted to the field hospital of the 1st
    division, Second Corps, where <name type="person" key="xx">Surgeon F. M. Hammond</name>, <name
     type="organization" key="364">126th New York</name>, noted &#34;a shot wound of the leg.&#34;
    On the following day the man was sent to <name type="place">City Point</name> and thence to
     <name type="place" key="#Washington">Washington</name>. <name type="person" key="245">Assistant
     Surgeon H. Allen</name>, <name type="organization" key="190">U. S. A.</name>, reported his
    admission to <name type="hospital" key="165">Mount Pleasant Hospital</name>
    <date type="transfer" when="1865-04-02">April 2d</date>, and contributed the following history:
    &#34;Gunshot wound of left lower extremity, ball passing through popliteal space from without
    inward, injuring the popliteal artery. When admitted the patient's pulse was small, sharp, and
    fast; face pale and tongue coated. His toes were of a bluish tint, and the foot was covered with
    bluish and yellowish purple spots. The entire leg was greatly swollen and the superficial veins
    enlarged; the small veins of the lower third of the thigh, on the external surface, were
    somewhat discolored, and the integument was assuming a yellowish color. The limb was amputated
    at the lower third of the thigh, on <date type="operation" when="1865-04-02">the day of
     admission</date>, by <name type="person" key="876">Acting Assistant Surgeon H. Craft</name>.
    The operation was performed by the circular method, very little blood being lost. Two double
    ligatures were applied to the femoral and four to the branches. The an&#230;sthetic consisted of
    equal parts of &#230;ther and chloroform. After the operation, cold-water dressings were
    applied, and a stimulating course adopted. The ligatures came away on the sixth and seventh
    days. On May 10th, there were symptoms of the femur exfoliating. The stump was nearly healed,
    when a collection of pus formed around the bone, and to give exit to it an incision was made
    just above the end of the stump. This was kept open by a tent and the stump encouraged to heal.
    Simple dressings were continued, and the tonic and stimulating course was persevered in. The
    exfoliating process steadily progressed up to June 19th, when a sequestrum was removed which
    proved to be nine inches long and was nearly a perfect shaft, extending nearly or quite to the
    trochanter major. It had only been partially destroyed on its under surface, and a new shaft of
    bone had formed around it. The stimulants and tonics were now increased, with nourishing diet,
    and by June 30th the patient was progressing favorably.&#34; The sequestrum was forwarded to the
     <name type="hospital" key="431">Army Medical Museum</name> by <name type="person" key="245">Dr.
     Allen</name>, and is represented in the annexed cut (<hi rend="initialcap">F</hi>IG. 1). The
    patient was subsequently transferred to <name type="place">Rochester</name>, and ultimately
    discharged from Ira Harris Hospital, <name type="place">Albany</name>, <date
     type="servicedischarge" when="1865-09-25">September 25, 1865</date>. <name type="person"
     key="xx">Assistant Surgeon J. H. Armsby</name>, <name type="organization" key="132">U. S.
     V.</name>, contributed a cast of the stump (<hi rend="italic">Cat. Surg. Sect.</hi>, 1866, p.
    554), which shows the inferior portion to be baggy, and a deep and poorly healed cicatrix at
    that point, caused by loss of substance over the bone (<hi rend="initialcap">F</hi>IG. 2). <name
     type="person" key="xx">Examiner G. W. Cook</name>, of <name type="place">Syracuse, N.
    Y.</name>, <date type="pension" when="1873-07-09">July 9, 1873</date>, certified:
    &#34;Tenderness of stump and slight covering over end of bone. He does not, nor can he, wear an
    artificial limb.&#34; The pensioner was paid <date type="pension" when="1876-06-04">June 4,
     1876</date>.</p>
