                    1863</date>, and admitted into <name type="hospital" key="167">Carver
                    Hospital</name> at Washington, D. C., on <date type="admit" when="1863-05-07"
                    >May 7th, 1863</date>. His injury was supposed to be a simple scalp wound from a
                musket ball. It was situated over the right parietal protuberance, and on admission
                was granulating kindly. Ten days subsequently the patient, after a walk out of doors
                and sitting in the hot sun, had headache and nausea, and the wound gaped and its
                edges ulcerated. On <date type="injury" when="1863-05-17">May 17th</date> there was
                headache, and his stomach would not retain food. On May 18th the probe detected
                denuded bone; but no fracture was discovered. There were no febrile or cerebral
                symptoms. On May 20th a depression of the outer table of the skull was detected. At
                night there was delirium, and the following day the pulse became feeble and
                irregular, the stomach irritable, the tongue heavily furred. On this and the
                following nights the patient had two and a half grains of opium at bedtime. His diet
                was low, though chicken broth and custard were allowed. On this day there was a
                decided icteric hue over the whole surface. The patient died on <date type="death"
                    when="1863-05-22">May 22d, 1863</date>, being conscious and rational to the
                last. At the autopsy, extensive inflammation of the dura mater was observed, and
                softening of the middle lobe of the right cerebral hemisphere. The notes of the case
                were drawn up by <name type="person" key="1481">Assistant Surgeon E. F.
                Bates</name>, <name type="organization" key="132">U. S. V.</name>, and were
                contributed with the specimen, which is represented in the wood-cuts above, (<hi

                    key="132">U. S. V.</name> The fracture of the external table is half an inch in
                diameter, and is depressed two lines. The inner table is fractured to the diameter
                of an inch, and depressed in the centre one line. A few hairs are wedged in among
                the fragments. The surrounding bone is porous and cribriform.</p>
