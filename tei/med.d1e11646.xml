                                age 35; a paroled prisoner; was admitted <date type="admit" when="1863-05-02">May 2, 1863</date>, having
                                        been taken sick while <hi rend="italic">en route</hi> from Richmond, Va., to his
                                        home. He had severe and persistent vomiting, ejecting a
                                        watery fluid mixed with bile and portions of undigested
                                        food. He was more or less comatose from the first, but
                                        sometimes answered questions rationally. There was no
                                        epigastric or hepatic tenderness, and no evidence of pain
                                        except on the 12th, when he complained of his right hip.
                                        His tongue was dry, thirst excessive, urine copious and
                                        passed involuntarily, and his bowels, although constipated,
                                        were readily moved by enemata. Oxalate of cerium, creasote,
                                        bismuth, morphia and chloroform with counter-irritants were
                                        employed, without success, to check the vomiting. Only
                                        raw eggs and small quantities of milk were retained.
                                        Nourishing enemata were frequently administered.  He died on

                                        emaciated. The brain was not examined. The thoracic viscera
                                        were healthy. The liver was rather larger than normal, but
                                        healthy. The stomach was normal in size and contained some
                                        watery fluid; its mucous membrane was reddened and its
                                        pyloric orifice contracted. At the commencement of the
                                        duodenum there was a firm well-marked constriction, reducing
                                        its calibre to less than half an inch in diameter. Around
                                        this portion of the intestine were deposits of coagulable
                                        lymph, and immediately below, on the posterior aspect of the
                                        gut, was a perforation with thickened and introverted edges.
                                        The gall-bladder was distended. The kidneys were normal.&#8212;<hi rend="italic"><name type="person">Ass't Surgeon Charles B.
