     McConkey</name>, <name type="organization" key="93">Co. D, 63d Pennsylvania</name>, aged 48
    years, was wounded at <name type="BATTLE" key="12">the Wilderness</name>, <date type="injury" when="1864-05-05">May 5, 1864</date>, by a conoidal ball, which entered on the inner condyle of
    the left knee, passed through the joint, and made its exit on the opposite side. He was conveyed
    to <name type="place" key="#Washington">Washington</name>, and admitted into the <name type="hospital" key="173">Harewood Hospital</name> on <date type="admit" when="1864-05-14">May
     14th</date>. <name type="person" key="158">Surgeon R. B. Bontecou</name>, <name type="organization" key="132">U. S. V.</name>, furnishes the following notes of the case: "An
    examination of the injury was immediately made; the soft parts around the wound were found much
    inflamed and the joint œdematous. His general condition being good, it was decided to
    amputate <date type="operation" when="1864-05-14">without delay</date>, and the patient being
    chloroformed, <name type="person" key="158">Surgeon Bontecou</name> removed the thigh in the
    lower third by the lateral flap operation. The stump healed favorably, the ligatures came away
    on the eighth day, and the patient progressed well on a supporting diet until, July 29th, he had
    so far recovered as to be about on crutches, when he accidentally fell, injuring the stump,
    which became inflamed; alcohol and water dressings were applied. On August 4th, an abscess was
    opened, which discharged about four ounces of pus. 5th, he had a severe attack of diarrhœa,
    which was checked by proper treatment. 30th, condition very good; a small sinus still exists,
    owing to some necrosed bone." He was transferred to <name type="place"><choice>
      <orig>Pittsburg</orig>
      <reg>Pittsburgh</reg>
     </choice></name>, <date type="transfer" when="1865-04-03">April 3, 1865</date>, and admitted
    into hospital there. The wound had entirely healed, and he was discharged <date type="servicedischarge" when="1865-05-19">May 19, 1865</date>. He was pensioned, and died <date type="death" when="1873-05-15">May 15, 1873</date>; the cause of death is not satisfactorily
    given. The pathological specimen, showing the bones of the left knee, with the articular
    extremity of the femur shattered (No. 3066, <hi rend="italic">Sect</hi>. I, A. M. M., <hi rend="italic">Cat</hi>., 1866, p. 338), was contributed by <name type="person" key="158">the
