                                                when="1861-09-04">Sept. 4, 1861</date>, with a high
                                        grade of inflammatory fever, presenting marked remissions
                                        and accompanied with flushed face, bloodshot eyes, hot and
                                        moist skin, yellow-coated tongue, regular bowels, anorexia
                                        and slight tonsillitis. Quinia and a gargle were ordered. On
                                        the 7th the fever lost its remittent character and was
                                        accompanied with headache, dry tongue and frequent stools;
                                        pulse 80. Turpentine emulsion, beef-essence and milk were
                                        substituted for the quinine. On the 11th diarrh&#339;a,
                                        tympanites and tinnitus aurium were noted; pulse 88. Dover's
                                        powder was given at night. The patient rested well and had
                                        some appetite next morning; the bowels were quiet, but the
                                        skin was hot and dry and the pulse 108; a slight eruption
                                        had appeared on the penis and scrotum. In the evening the
                                        pulse was 100, the tongue moist and slightly coated; the
                                        patient had two stools and some tympanites during the day.
                                        The Dover's powder at night was continued. On the 16th the
                                        bowels were regular and there was some appetite; pulse 75 and skin
                                        moist. On the 17th the tongue was cleaning, the appetite
                                        good, the pulse 80 and the bowels regular. Dover's powder
                                        was continued. On the 18th the report is varied by noting
                                        abdominal tenderness with one stool, and on the 19th by
                                        dryness of skin, the tongue continuing moist, slight
                                        deafness, cough, respiration increased to 24 per minute and
                                        bowels tympanitic, slightly tender in the right iliac region
                                        and moved twice. Twelve grains of quinine were given.
                                        Copious sweating occurred during the night and sudamina
                                        appeared, the bowels again becoming regular and the
                                        respiration natural. On the evening of the 22d pain recurred
                                        in the abdomen with two stools, dryness of skin, some
                                        headache and increase of the pulse to 100. Next day two
                                        stools were again reported, but the skin had recovered its
                                        moisture and the tongue was natural. On the 24th there was
                                        slight deafness but no cough nor pain; the tongue and skin
                                        were in natural condition and the appetite good. Again on
                                        the evening of the 26th, with an acceleration of the pulse
                                        and dryness of skin, there was abdominal pain with
                                        borborygmus, followed by free perspiration during the night.
                                        From this date to <date type="transfer" when="1861-10-01">October 1</date>, when he was transferred to
                                        <name type="place">Annapolis, Md.</name>, the patient slept well, had a good appetite,
                                        moist and clean or yellow-patched tongue and natural skin;
                                        but there was more or less abdominal pain with from two to
                                        four stools daily. </p>
