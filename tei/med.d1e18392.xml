                                                  conoidal ball, which entered the left side of the
                                                  neck just below the submaxillary gland, traversed
                                                  the base of the tongue, and lodged upon the right
                                                  side just below the base of the jaw. He was taken
                                                  to the regimental hospital; the ball could be felt in seat
                                                  of lodgement. The patient was so refractory that

                                                  an&#230;sthesia was induced with difficulty. The ball

                                                  the ball by way of entrance, but extraction was
                                                  impracticable. On <date type="admit" when="1863-06-14">June 14th</date>, he was sent to <name type="hospital" key="165">Mount Pleasant Hospital</name>, Washington, and, on <date type="transfer" when="1863-06-16">June 16th</date>, to West's Buildings Hospital, <name type="place">Baltimore</name>, whence
