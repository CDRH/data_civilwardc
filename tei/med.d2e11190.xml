      2, 1863</date>, by a twelve-pounder solid shot, which shattered his right leg. He dismounted
     unassisted, and aid arriving promptly, he was removed to a sheltered ravine a short distance to
     the rear, where the limb was amputated low down in the thigh by <name type="person" key="946">Surgeon T. Sim</name>, <name type="organization" key="132">U. S. V.</name>, Medical Director
     of the Corps. The patient was then sent farther to the rear, and, on <date type="transfer" when="1863-07-03">the following day</date>, he was
     transferred to <name type="place" key="#Washington">Washington</name>. The stump healed with great rapidity. Two weeks after the injury the
     patient was able to ride about in a carriage, and early in September he was well enough to
     again mount a horse, the stump being completely cicatrized. The bones of the amputated leg (<hi rend="italic">Spec</hi>. 1335) were contributed to <name type="hospital" key="431">the Museum</name> by the patient, and the history of the case was obtained from <name type="person" key="946">the operator</name>.  <name type="person" key="1077">General Sickles</name> subsequently for several years held
     command in <name type="place">South Carolina</name> and the <name type="organization" key="xxx">Department of the South</name>, but has been retired from active
