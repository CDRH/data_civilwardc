                                        typhoid fever. The pulse on admission was 90 and quick; the
                                        skin hot and dry, exhibiting a profuse eruption; the tongue

                                        patient had slight headache, cough and pain in micturition.
                                        Wine and cinchona bark were ordered. The eruption faded, but
                                        no other change took place until the 13th, when the tongue
                                        became dry. One ounce of Epsom salt was given. Three stools
                                        were passed on each of the two following days, and the
                                        tenderness became more marked in the right iliac region;
                                        otherwise there was no change. The Epsom salt was repeated
                                        on the 16th. Three stools were passed on the 17th and one on
                                        the 18th. Vibices appeared on the chest and rose-spots on
                                        the abdomen on the 19th. A few more rose-spots were detected
                                        on the 30th. During this period the skin was generally of
