                                        years. The brain was healthy. The right lung was congested
                                        and weighed twenty-five ounces; the left twenty-six ounces,
                                        its lower lobe being intensely engorged and in some parts
                                        hepatized. The right side of the heart contained a blackish
                                        clot of moderate size; the left ventricle a smaller clot.
                                        The liver was pale, its acini well defined, its texture
                                        softer than usual, its weight seventy-three ounces and a
                                        half; the gall-bladder contained five drachms of deep-yellow
                                        flaky bile. The spleen was soft, deep purplish-black and
                                        weighed eighteen ounces. The pancreas and kidneys were
                                        normal. The stomach was red at the fundus. Peyer's patches
                                        were indurated, thickened and in many places ulcerated. The
                                        solitary glands were so numerous that on a square inch
                                        selected at random fifteen were counted; they were large,
                                        about two lines in diameter. The mucous membrane of the
                                        large intestine was generally mottled red, but in the
                                        ascending colon it was of a light slate color mottled with
                                        red; the solitary glands in the c&#230;cum were enlarged
                                        and several of them ulcerated.&#8212;<hi rend="italic"
