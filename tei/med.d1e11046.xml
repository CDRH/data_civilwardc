                        <p> <hi rend="initialcap">C</hi>ASE 97.&#8212;<name type="person">Private Clark D. Dexter</name>, <name type="organization">Co. L, 10th N. Y. Cav.</name>; age 21; was admitted <date type="admit" when="1863-02-19">Feb. 19, 1863</date>, as a convalescent from typhoid fever. He
                                        improved and in a short time had entirely recovered.  On
                                        March 21 he complained of pain in the upper part of the
                                        chest on both sides and of some cough, but no dyspn&#339;a;
                                        sonorous <choice><sic>ronchus</sic><corr>rhonchus</corr></choice> was heard, but both sides were resonant.  Two days later, having been treated in the meantime with dry
                                        cups, blue-pill and ipecacuanha, the pain and cough had
                                        increased, the expectoration was slightly tinged with blood,
                                        and there was <choice><orig>dulness</orig><reg>dullness</reg></choice> with subcrepitant r&#226;les over the
                                        upper part of the left side.  He suffered much from pain
                                        during the night of the 24th and did not sleep; next morning
                                        the expectoration was decidedly pneumonitic. Calomel,
                                        muriate of ammonia and Dover's powder were given every
                                        three hours; a blister was applied over the left lung and
                                        the whole chest was covered with an oil-silk jacket.  On the
                                        26th the abdomen was so painful and tender that complaint
                                        was made of the weight of the bedclothes.  On the 28th there
                                        was bronchial respiration with <choice><orig>dulness</orig><reg>dullness</reg></choice> on percussion over
                                        the entire left lung. Carbonate of ammonia, syrup of squill
                                        and camphorated tincture of opium were given, with beef-tea
                                        and milk-punch.  Next day the upper part of the right lung
                                        became involved; respiration was hurried and laborious.  He
                                        died on <date type="death" when="1863-03-31">the 31st</date>.   <hi rend="italic">Post-mortem</hi> examination: Body somewhat
                                        emaciated. The brain was healthy. The right lung,
                                        twenty-five ounces, was partly adherent; the posterior part
                                        of its upper lobe was consolidated and grayish-purple; the
                                        remaining lobes were healthy. The left pleural sac contained
                                        nine ounces of serum; the lung, twenty-five ounces, was
                                        adherent to the parietes by thick, tough, recent lymph; its
                                        upper lobe was hepatized red, the lower lobe highly
                                        congested but not solidified. The right cavities of the
                                        heart were filled with fibrinous and mixed clots which
                                        extended into the pulmonary artery, and there were
                                        some patches of atheroma in the aorta. The omentum was
                                        contracted and drawn to the right side; the knuckles of
                                        intestine were united by a soft exudation. The liver,
                                        seventy-three ounces, was rather soft and adherent to
                                        adjoining organs in several places. The spleen, seven
                                        ounces and a half, was soft; the pancreas normal; the
                                        kidneys pale; the suprarenal capsules dark-colored; the
                                        mucous membrane of the bladder was injected and presented a
                                        number of black-bordered brown spots about a quarter of an
                                        inch in diameter. The mucous membrane of the stomach and
                                        duodenum was gray and not injected; in the rest of the
                                        small intestine the mucous membrane was of a light
                                        red-lead color; Peyer's patches were healthy to within four
                                        feet of the ileoc&#230;cal valve, below this point they were
                                        dark-colored but not elevated; the solitary glands were not
                                        visible, and there was no softening of the mucous membrane;
                                        the small intestine was distended with gas. The mucous
                                        membrane of the c&#230;cum was gray and the solitary follicles
                                        numerous and prominent; the transverse colon was
                                        contracted; the rest of the large intestine normal.&#8212;<hi rend="italic"><name type="person" key="245">Ass't Surgeon Harrison Allen</name>, <name type="organization" key="190">U.
