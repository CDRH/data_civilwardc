      a horse.</hi>—<name type="person" key="1424">Lieutenant E. Whitfield</name>, <name type="organization" key="537">Co. I, 22d New York Cavalry</name>, aged 29 years, was injured
     in the right side by falling from his horse near Leesburg, <date type="injury" when="1864-07-12">July 12, 1864</date>.  <name type="person" key="1423">Acting Assistant
       Surgeon A. Edelin</name>, who attended him at <name type="place" key="#Washington">Washington</name>, reported that the injury involved a
     "fracture of ribs, which had not yet united on October 19."  <date type="furlough" when="1864-11">Several weeks later</date> the patient
     obtained a leave of absence, and on <date type="servicedischarge" when="1864-12-19">December 19,
      1864</date>, he was discharged from service and pensioned.  <name type="person" key="xx">Examiner J. D. Button</name>, of <name type="place" key="xx">Auburn, N. Y.</name>,
     certified, <date type="pension" when="1870-02-09">February 9, 1870</date>:  "The sixth and seventh ribs on the right side were fractured and
     dislocated from the sternum, and not being properly adjusted an imperfect cure was the result.
     There is a projection of two inches outward from the chest at the ends of those two fractured
     ribs, which are not joined to the sternum. The muscles which move the arm are weakened and
     exercise causes pain."  Subsequent examiners report the existence of an ulcer on the left thigh, alleged to be the result of a wound of the knee by a
     spent ball, which was also corroborated by the <name type="organization" key="xx">Auburn
      Examining Board</name>. The latter, on <date type="pension" when="1877-12-05">December 5, 1877</date>, described the projection caused by
     the fractured ribs, and added that the pensioner "has an anxious expression of countenance;
     distended nasal <choice><orig>alas</orig><reg>alae</reg></choice>; respiration easily disturbed; loud resonance and weak respiration in
     right lung, indicating emphysematous condition of the lung."  The pensioner was paid <date type="pension" when="1881-09-04">September 4, 1881</date>. </p>
