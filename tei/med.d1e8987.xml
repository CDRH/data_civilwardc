                Sergeant, <name type="organization" key="503">Co. H, 8th New York Cavalry</name>,
                aged 27 years, was wounded, before <name type="BATTLE" key="xx">Petersburg,

                by a pistol ball which entered one inch above and one and a half inches to the left
                of the occipital protuberance and emerged just below it on the opposite side,
                denuding the bone of pericranium. He was admitted to the hospital of the 3d
                division, Cavalry Corps, and on <date type="transfer" when="1865-04-03">the
                    3d</date>, was sent to <name type="place" key="#Washington">Washington</name>,
                where he entered <name type="hospital" key="173">Harewood Hospital</name> on <date type="admit" when="1865-04-05">the 5th</date>. Until <date type="injury" when="1865-04-14">the 14th</date>, the patient seemed to be improving, but on
                that day a slight hæmorrhage from the occipital artery occurred, causing the
                loss of about six ounces of arterial blood. The hæmorrhage was arrested by
                means of compression, and the case apparently progressed favorably. On the evening
                of the 18th, the patient, however, complained of considerable pain in the region of
                the cerebellum. On <date type="operation" when="1865-04-19">the following day</date>
                considerable gastric irritation manifested itself, and, at intervals, there was
                slight delirium. Ether was administered, and <name type="person" key="158">Surgeon
                    R. B. Bontecou</name>, <name type="organization" key="132">U. S. V.</name>, made
                an incision two and a half inches in length, just below and parallel to the
                lambdoidal suture, retracted the scalp, applied the trephine, and removed a disk of
                bone, giving exit to a quantity of pus. The patient reacted promptly, after the
                operation, and seemed to be much relieved, but in the evening he began to sink, and
                died on the morning of <date type="death" when="1865-04-21">April 21st, 1865</date>.
                The autopsy revealed a large abscess in the left lobe of the cerebellum, which
                contained four or five ounces of pus. The medulla oblongata was implicated. The
                pathological specimen is represented in the adjacent wood-cut, (<hi rend="initialcap">F</hi>IG. 43,) and shows the occipital bone perforated by a
                trephine, with the disk restored to its position. The surrounding portion of the
                external table is slightly discolored and cribriform. The specimen was contributed
                by the operator. A photograph of the case will be found in the Photographic Surgical
                Series of the Army Medical Museum, Volume I, page 40. </p>
