     Covell</name>, <name type="organization" key="487">Co. C, 52d New York</name>, aged 38 years,
    was wounded in the left foot, at <name type="BATTLE" key="250"><choice>

    the field hospital of the 1st division, Second Corps. <name type="person" key="xx">Surgeon J. W.
     Wishart</name>, <name type="organization" key="230">140th Pennsylvania</name>, described the
    injury as a "shell wound of the tarsal and metatarsal bones," for which he performed "Syme's
    amputation at the ankle joint." <date type="transfer" when="1864-05-28">Ten days after being
     wounded</date> the patient entered <name type="hospital" key="172">Emory Hospital</name> at
    Washington, and subsequently he was transferred to Central Park Hospital, <name type="place"
     key="xx">New York City</name>. <name type="person" key="xx">Surgeon B. A. Clements</name>,
     <name type="organization" key="190">U. S. A.</name>, in charge of the latter, reported the
    following history of the case: "Considerable h&#230;morrhage took place at the time of the
    injury, and the man's general condition was not very good in consequence of his suffering from
    diarrh&#339;a. Amputation at the ankle joint was performed under chloroform <date
     type="operqation" when="1864-05-18">six hours after the reception of the injury</date>, the
    ends of the tibia and fibula also being removed. Sutures, adhesive strips, and cold-water
    dressings were applied. The parts did not unite by first intention, though there was no
    sloughing nor necrosis. When the patient was admitted to Central Park Hospital, <date
     type="transfer" when="1864-08-17">August 17th</date>, the stump had healed with the exception
    of a small ulcer in the cicatrix near the external angle of the flaps, and his general condition
    was pretty good, though he still had diarrh&#339;a. By October 2d the stump was entirely healed
    and the diarrh&#339;a was much improved." The patient was discharged from service <date
     type="servicedischarge" when="1864-11-03">November 3, 1864</date>, and pensioned, having been
    previously furnished with an artificial foot. A cast of the stump (<hi rend="italic">Spec</hi>.
    4369) was contributed to <name type="hospital" key="431">the Museum</name> by <name
     type="person" key="1385">Surgeon J. J. Milhan</name>, <name type="organization" key="190">U. S.
     A.</name>, and is represented in the adjoining wood-cut (<hi rend="initialcap">F</hi>IG. 345).
    After leaving the service the stump was re-amputated at the lower third of the leg on <date
     type="operation" when="1869-05-05">May 5, 1869</date>. In his subsequent applications for
    commutation the pensioner described the condition of the stump as "sound and healthy." His
    pension was paid <date type="pension" when="1881-09-04">September 4, 1881</date>.&#185;</p>
