                                                1865</date>, with typho-malarial fever. He was
                                        received from the provisional camp, Virginia, in a critical
                                        condition. His sickness had lasted ten weeks. When admitted
                                        he was under the influence of a chill, which was followed by
                                        fever and profuse perspiration. He was delirious most of the
                                        time. His tongue was coated and very red; bowels regular;
                                        pulse 110 and feeble, and he experienced much difficulty in
                                        urinating. Three grains of quinine and Dover's powder were
                                        directed to be given every three hours, and twenty grains of
                                        calomel at night, followed by a full dose of castor oil and
                                        opium in the morning. Brandy was added to the treatment on
                                        <date when="1865-05-22">the 22d</date>, on which day the fever and perspirations continued,
                                        with difficulty of swallowing and much gastric irritability.
                                        Hiccough and subsultus tendinum appeared on <date when="1865-05-23">the 23d</date>, with
