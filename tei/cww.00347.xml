                <p>That your Petitioner acquired his claim to the aforesaid Service or labor of said

                    the value of <hi rend="underline">Five hundred</hi> ($500) <hi rend="underline"
                        >Dollars</hi> in <pb xml:id="leaf001v" facs="cww.00347.002.jpg"/>
                    money&#8212;her lameness does not interfere with her usefulness, or
                    health&#8212;She is a house servant, active, intelligent &#38; industrious &#38;
                    is honest, religiously inclined very faithful &#38; obedient&#8212;.</p>

                <p>Your Petitioner hereby declares that he bears true &#38; faithful allegiance to

                <p>And your Petitioner further states &#38; alleges, that he has not brought said
                        <persName>Jane Turner Campbell</persName> into the <placeName>District of

                    virtue of your Petitioner's claim to such service or labor.</p>

                <p>Your Petitioner further states &#38; alleges that his said claim to the service
                    or labor of said <persName>Jane Turner Campbell</persName> does not originate in

                        Turner Campbell</persName> herein above set forth; and if the same be found
                    to be valid, that they appraise &#38; apportion the value of said claim in
