                    key="248">Fort Stevens</name>. It appears almost incredible that the patient

                    >the following day</date> an autopsy was made. Over the anterior superior angle
                of the left parietal bone there was an extended scalp wound. On reflecting the
                scalp, multiple depressed fractures of the vault of the cranium came into view. The
                point of greatest depression is an inch to the left of the median line, near the
                coronal suture. The depressed fragments measure from before backward two inches, and
                from right to left three inches, and involve both parietals and the <hi
                    rend="italic">os frontis</hi>. A fissure runs through the squamous portion of
                the left temporal, and all the sutures of this bone are separated. The autopsy was
                made and the specimen was forwarded by <name type="person" key="246">Acting
