      Wyman</name>, <name type="organization" key="177">Co. A, 6th Wisconsin</name>, aged 22 years,
     was wounded in the right leg, at <name type="BATTLE" key="78">Hatcher's Run</name>, <date type="injury" when="1865-02-07">February 7, 1865</date>. <name type="person" key="xx">Surgeon
      D. C. Chamberlain</name>, <name type="organization" key="180">94th New York</name>, reported
     his admission to the field hospital of the 3d division,Fifth Corps, and described the injury as a "fracture of tibia." From the field the wounded
     man passed to the Point Lookout Hospital, subsequently to <name type="hospital" key="428">Judiciary Square Hospital</name>, Washington, and on <date
      type="transfer" when="1865-06-15">June 15th</date> to Harvey Hospital, at <name type="place">Madison</name>.  <name type="person" key="xx">Surgeon H. Culbertson</name>, <name
      type="organization" key="132">U. S. V.</name>, in charge of the latter, who operated in the
     case, communicated the following description of the result: "The tibia was fractured in the
     upper fourth. On <date type="operation" when="1865-07-02">July 2d</date>, when the operation was performed, the wound was apparently healing,
     but had recently been gangrenous. Venous h&#230;morrhage appeared, and the bone was carious and
     softened. Some new bone had been thrown out at the seat of the fracture and had also become
     diseased. This presence of diseased bone and unhealthy discharges induced the h&#230;morrhage and previous gangrene and caused the patient's
     constitutional condition to be much impaired. The operation consisted of the excision of five
     inches of the shaft of the tibia, beginning opposite the opening of the interosseus membrane,
     making an incision in the middle line of the bone, and separating the skin, periosteum, and
     muscles by enucleation. The chain saw was then passed beneath the bone below, the shaft sawn
     through and raised from below upward. At the upper part the bone was divided with the forceps.
     No vessels were divided or important nerves injured during the operation. Chloroform was used as the an&#230;sthetic with good effects. The edges of the wound
     were approximated, having been packed with lint, and persulphate of iron was used at the seat
     of the venous h&#230;morrhage, a light bandage being applied over all. The limb was secured in
     a plaster-of-Paris splint and arranged so as to expose the wound. The treatment consisted of
     animal broths, alcoholic stimulants, quinine, and iron. The case did well for one week, when
     the patient had a slight chill, which recurred at regular intervals morning and evening, and
     was followed by fever and sweating. Antiperiodics were persistently used without any good
     effect. The patient died of exhaustion, resulting from typho-malarial fever, <date type="death"
      when="1865-07-23">July 23, 1865</date>. The wound had been lacking in action, but the matter,
     though sparse, was healthy." </p>
