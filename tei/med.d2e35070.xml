The finger introduced in the rectum discovered a ragged wound about three and a half inches from the anus. F&#230;cal matter passed by the orifice in the thigh.  On <date type="operation" when="1861-09-22">September 22d</date>, the sphincter was divided; but f&#230;ces continued to pass by the wound in the thigh until October 4th, when the natural evacuations took place, with great relief.  The wound-track in the thigh was unavailingly dilated with compressed sponge to promote elimination of fragments from the ischium, and on <date type="operation" when="1862-02-19">February 19, 1862</date>, an incision was made and some pieces of necrosed bone were removed.  <name type="person" key="xxx">Assistant Surgeon S.
