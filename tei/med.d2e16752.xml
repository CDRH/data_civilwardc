    flaps, on <date type="operation" when="1862-09-28">September 28th</date>. Secondary h&#230;morrhage to the amount of sixteen ounces occurred on <date type="operation" when="1862-10-04">October 4th</date> from the popliteal
    artery, when the stump was opened, the vessel dissected up for about two inches, and again tied. <date type="operation" when="1862-10-07">Three days afterwards</date> h&#230;morrhage recurred; the stump was again reopened and the artery dissected up into Hunter's canal, where, becoming the femoral, it was then ligated. No further bleeding took place, and the patient recovered with a beautifully firm and broad stump.&#34; The
    patient was discharged from service <date type="servicedischarge" when="1862-12-16">December 16, 1862</date>, and pensioned. He was paid <date type="pension" when="1880-03-04">March 4, 1880</date>. The stump was described
    to be in good condition in the pensioner's application for commutation.</p>
