   <p>Case from the case-book of the <name type="hospital" key="501"><hi rend="initialcap">T</hi>HIRD <hi rend="initialcap">D</hi>IVISION</name> of the <name type="place" key="#Alexandria"><hi rend="initialcap">A</hi>LEXANDRIA</name> <hi rend="initialcap">H</hi>OSPITAL, <name type="person" key="134">Surgeon Edwin Bentley</name>, <name type="organization" key="132">U.

   <p>CASE 493. Private Adam Scott, company G, 143d New York volunteers; age 59; admitted <date type="admit" when="1863-09-26">September 26, 1863</date>.  Chronic diarrh&#339;a of five months duration.  [This man appears on the hospital register of his regiment, sent to general hospital <date type="transfer" when="1863-09-24">September 24th</date>&#8212;typhoid fever.]  The patient was greatly emaciated; his stomach very irritable; he had severe tenesmus, and passages from the bowels almost every half hour through the day and night.  Treatment: Tonics, alteratives, astringents and opiates.  Died, <date type="death" when="1863-11-09">November 9th</date>.  <hi rend="italic">Autopsy</hi> <date type="autopsy" when="1863-11-10">twenty hours after death</date>: Body much emaciated; there were old pleuritic adhesions on both sides. An intussusception four inches long was found in the ileum. The whole length of the colon was contracted, its lumen being about half an inch in diameter. The liver was small.</p> 
   <p>&#8432; It is to be regretted that, in most instances, the records of this hospital do not show by whom the autopsies were made. It is known that many of them were made by <name type="person" key="134">Surgeon Bentley</name> himself, or under his immediate supervision, but it is only possible to distinguish these from the others in a few cases.</p>
