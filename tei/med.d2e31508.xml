E, 74th Pennsylvania</name>, was wounded at <name type="battle" key="xxx">Rappahannock</name>, <date type="injury" when="1862-08-22">August 22, 1862</date>.  He was admitted into <name type="hospital" key="428">Judiciary Square Hospital</name> at Washington on <date type="admit" when="1862-08-24">August 24th</date>, where he died.  <name type="person" key="xxx">Acting Assistant Surgeon F. H. Brown</name> states: "Gunshot wound; entrance two inches to the left of the median line, on a level with the top of the sacrum; the track of the ball was not marked; it was excised from beneath the integument four inches to the right of the median line, at the level of the umbilicus. On <date type="injury" when="1862-08-26">the 26th</date>, there was considerable fever, and peritonitis commenced and increased rapidly, and the patient died, rather suddenly, on <date type="death" when="1862-08-27">the 27th</date>, having had considerable trouble in respiration during the day.  At the autopsy, the descending colon was found pierced opposite the wound of exit; there was a considerable quantity of liquid f&#230;ces in the cavity of the abdomen, and adhesions of the peritoneum and pleura about the seat of injury.  In this case, though some tenderness existed, no symptoms at all commensurate with the lesion were present until within thirty-six hours of death, and on the supervention of peritonitis. The presence of the f&#230;ces in the abdomen did not cause the usual acute pain produced by foreign bodies in the peritoneal cavity." </p>
