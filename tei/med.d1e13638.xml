                    while in a state of unconsciousness, a ball struck the right foot on its outer
                    edge, near the middle, and, passing inward and upward, emerged at the instep;

                    patient was subject to pain in the head, and his memory was greatly impaired.
                    The foot was anchylosed and cold. His disability is rated total and
