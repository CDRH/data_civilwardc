    laborer of the <name type="organization" key="xx">Commissary Department, <name
      type="organization" key="190">U. S. A.</name></name>, aged 36 years, was run over by a city
    passenger railroad car at <name type="place" key="#Washington">Washington</name>, <date
     type="injury" when="1863-08-10">August 10, 1863</date>, and died at <name type="hospital"
     key="162">Douglas Hospital</name>
    <date type="death" when="1863-08-10">one hour after the accident</date>. <name type="person"
     key="616">Acting Assistant Surgeon J. E. Smith</name> made the following report of the injury:
    "Everything to alleviate his sufferings was done that could be, but the man did not react from
    the shock in the least. At the autopsy a tumor was observed on the right side of the throat
    which was supposed to have resulted from the injury, but on cutting down upon it I discovered it
    to be a pre-existing enlargement of the thyroid gland. A section of the tumor displayed fatty
    degeneration of the greater part with two sacs, each containing about one-half ounce of
    sero-sanguinolent fluid. The left inferior portion of the tumor was ossified. Previous to his
    death the patient had passed bloody urine which could not be satisfactorily accounted for, the
    kidneys, ureter, and bladder being found apparently uninjured. The right humerus was comminuted,
    as were also the radius and ulna of each forearm. On the left anterior side the ribs were all
    broken except the twelfth, and the lung was considerably lacerated; posteriorly the same ribs
    were fractured except the first, second, and twelfth. The left scapula was transversely
    fractured below its spine and the left clavicle at its acromial extremity." The injured scapula
     (<hi rend="initialcap">F</hi>IG. 364, <hi rend="italic">Spec.</hi> 1631), humerus (<hi
     rend="italic">Spec.</hi> 1786), and both bones of both forearms (<hi rend="initialcap"
    >F</hi>IGS. 363, 365, <hi rend="italic">Spec.</hi> 1784 of the <hi rend="italic">Surgical
     Section</hi> of <name type="hospital" key="431">the Museum</name>), were contributed by <name
     type="person" key="200">Assistant Surgeon W. Thomson</name>, <name type="organization"
     key="190">U. S. A.</name>, and are represented in the adjoining wood-cuts. The left radius and
    ulna show an oblique fracture at the junction of the upper thirds, the superior fragments being
    wanting, while in the right radius a nearly transverse fracture exists in the lower part of the
    middle third and longitudinal fractures occupy the lower fragment. The lowest third of the right
    ulna is comminuted.</p>
