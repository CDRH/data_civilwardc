                <p>To the Commissioners under the act of Congress approved the <date
                        when="1862-04-16">16th of April, 1862</date>,
                    entitled "An Act for the release of certain persons held to service or labor in
                    the <placeName>District of Columbia</placeName>.</p>
                <p>Your Petitioner <persName>Ann Blake</persName> of the <placeName>City of
                        Washington</placeName>, by this her petition in writing, represents and
                    states that she is a person loyal to the <placeName>United States</placeName>,
                    who at the time of the passage of the said act of Congress, held a claim to
                    service or labor against <persName>Hannah Horden</persName>, a person of African
                    descent, of the name of <persName>Hannah Horden</persName> as aforesaid, for and
                    during the life of said <persName>Hannah</persName> and that by act of
                    Congress said <persName>Hannah</persName> is discharged and freed of and from
                    all claim of your petitioner to such service or labor; that at the time of said
                    discharge said <persName>Hannah</persName> was of the age of forty years, and of
                    the personal description following; black in color, five feet six inches in
                    height, with no peculiar marks or traits of appearance different from other
                    negroes.</p>

                <p>That your petitioner acquired her claim to the aforesaid service or labor of said
                        <persName>Hannah</persName> in manner following; to wit by purchase from one
                        <persName>Elizabeth Horden</persName>, in the year <date when="1846">1846</date> for the sum of seven hundred dollars, in the state of
                        <placeName>South Carolina</placeName>, by receipt and delivery, which receipt
                    has long since been lost, but that she has had possession of said
                        <persName>Hannah</persName> since that time. That your petitioners claim to service of
                    said <persName>Hannah</persName> was at the time of said discharge therefrom, of
                    the value <pb xml:id="leaf001v" facs="cww.00601.002.jpg"/>of Five hundred
                    Dollars in money, &#38; that she has no knowledge of any infirmity or defect
                    to impair said value.</p>
                <p>Your Petitioner hereby declares, that one bears true and faithful allegiance to the Government of the <placeName>United States</placeName>, and
                    that she has not borne arms against the <placeName>United States</placeName> in
                    the present rebellion, nor in any way given and or comfort thereto.</p>
                <p>And Your Petitioner further states &#38; alleges, that she has not brought said
                        <persName>Hannah</persName> into the <placeName>District of
                        Columbia</placeName> since the passage of said act of Congress; and that, at
                    the time of the passage thereof, said <persName>Hannah</persName> was held to
                    service or labor therein under and by virtue of your petitioner's claim to such
                    service or labor.</p>
                <p>Your Petitioner further states &#38; alleges, that her said claim to the service or
                    labor of said <persName>Hannah</persName> does not originate in, or by virtue of
                    any transfer heretofore made by any person who has in any manner aided or
                    sustained the present rebellion against the Government of the <placeName>United
                        States</placeName>.</p>
                <p>And Your Petitioner prays the said Commissioners to investigate and determine the
                    validity of her said claim to the service of said <persName>Hannah</persName>
                    herein above set forth; and of the same be found to be valid, that they appraise
                    and apportion the value of said claim in money, &#38; report the same to the
                    Secretary of the Treasury of the <placeName>United States</placeName>, in
                    conformity to the provisions of said Act of Congress.</p>
