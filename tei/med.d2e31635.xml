   <p>CASE 282. <name type="organization" key="xxx">Corporal John N. Payne</name>, <name type="organization" key="xxx">5th Vermont</name>, aged 34 years, in the general assault on <name type="BATTLE" key="58">Petersburg</name>, <date type="admit" when="1865-04-02"><date type="injury" when= "1865-04-02">April 2, 1865</date></date>, near <name type="place">Fort Welch</name>, received a shot wound of the abdomen, and was taken to the 2d division hospital of the Sixth Corps, under charge of <name type="person" key="xxx">Surgeon S. F. Chapin</name>, <name type="organization" key="xxx">139th Pennsylvania</name>, when the injury was registered as a “gunshot flesh wound of the abdomen.” On <date type="transfer" when= "1865-04-11">April 11th</date>, the patient was transferred to the depot field hospital of the Sixth Corps, under <name type="person" key="xxx">Assistant Surgeon J. S. Ely</name>, <name type="organization" key="132">U. S. V.</name>, who recorded the injury as a "gunshot flesh wound of the left side."  On <date type="transfer" when= "1865-04-12">April 12th</date>, the wounded man was sent to <name type="place" key="#Washington">Washington</name> and placed in <name type="hospital" key="173">Harewood Hospital</name>. <name type="person" key="158">Surgeon R. B. Bontecou</name>, <name type="organization" key="132">U. S. V.</name>, reports that "a musket ball entered over the left hypochondriac region, passed obliquely downward and backward, and emerged near the spine, injuring, in its course, the descending colon; f&#230;ces passed artificially at the exit of the ball. Simple dressings."  A photograph of the patient was made under Dr. Bontecou's direction. A reduced copy of this picture is presented in the accompanying wood-cut (<hi rend="initialcap">F</hi>IG. 60).  In a few weeks the wound healed entirely, and the patient was transferred to <name type="place">Vermont</name>, <date type="transfer" when= "1865-05-26">May 26th</date>, and admitted into Baxter Hospital, <name type="place">Burlington</name>, on <date type="admit" when= "1865-05-30">the 30th</date>.  On <date type="transfer" when= "1865-06-29">June 29th</date>, he was transferred to Sloan Hospital, <name type="place">Montpelier</name>, where <name type="organization" key="xxx">Surgeon Henry Janes</name>, <name type="organization" key="132">U. S. V.</name>, reviewing the history of the case, remarks: "The ball entered four inches from the median line, between the tenth and eleventh ribs on the left side, passed backward and downward and emerged behind, one inch above the crest of the ilium and two inches from the spine. The patient states that the shock was not great, and that he walked, without assistance, a half mile to the ambulance, which conveyed him about two and one-half miles to the field hospital. On <date type="transfer" when="1865-04-03">the next day</date>, he was taken about seventeen miles to the base hospital at <name type="place">City Point</name>, where he remained seven days. While there, a considerable quantity of foreign substance, mostly shreds of clothing, was removed from the posterior wound.  On <date when= "1865-04-10">April 10th</date>, he was transferred to <name type="hospital" key="173">Harewood Hospital</name>, Washington.  On <date when= "1865-04-13">April 13th</date>, after taking cathartic pills, other fragments of clothing were removed from the posterior wound.  April 14th, there was a stercoraceous discharge from the posterior wound. For the succeeding three weeks the descending colon was kept under the influence of opium. The f&#230;cal discharge then ceased, but intestinal gases escaped for several days longer. He had some colicky pains; but not much tenderness, and no vomiting. His appetite was pretty fair most of the time. On <date type="transfer" when= "1865-05-25">May 25th</date>, he was transferred to <name type="place">Burlington</name>.  The posterior wound closed early in June; the anterior opening healed a month later.  On <date type="transfer" when= "1865-06-29">June 29th</date>, he was transferred to Sloan Hospital, <name type="place">Montpelier</name>, since which time he has had a variable appetite and constipation; otherwise he is in fair health.  July 25th, he complains of some lameness along the course of the spine; passages from the bowels regular, appetite good, and patient gaining daily. These particulars are recorded on the back of a photograph made at Sloan Hospital.  <name type="person" key="xxx">Payne</name> was discharged from service <date type="servicedischarge" when= "1865-09-08">September 8, 1865</date>, and was pensioned.  <date type="pension" when= "1867-06-18">June 18, 1867</date>, <name type="person" key="xxx">Pension Examiner Marcus O. Porter</name> of <name type="place">Middlebury, New York</name>, reports: "A rifle ball entered just below the left nipple, between the tenth and eleventh ribs, passed backward and downward, and emerged three inches lower than the point of entrance. The intestines were penetrated and f&#230;cal matter passed out of the wound for three or four weeks. An adhesion of the intestines appears to have been formed to the abdominal wall at the point of exit of the ball. He is entirely unable to perform manual labor on account of weakness of the right side, and the pain and soreness excited by muscular effort."  He was last paid to <date type="pension" when= "1872-12-04">December 4, 1872</date>.</p>
