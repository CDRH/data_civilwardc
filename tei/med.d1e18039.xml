          <name type="organization">Co. C, 98th Pennsylvania Volunteers</name>, aged 24 years, was
        wounded at the battle of <name type="BATTLE" key="xx">Fredericksburg</name>, <date
          type="injury" when="1863-05-03">May 3d, 1863</date>, by a conoidal ball, which entered the
        left side of the face, about one inch below the eye, and passed inward and backward,
        entering the mouth, fracturing the hard palate and inferior maxilla, and totally destroying
        sight of left eye; then passed out again to the right side of the neck, and lodged
        superficially about one inch and one-half below the right ear. He was on <date type="admit"
          when="1863-05-07">May 7th</date> admitted to <name type="hospital" key="174">Campbell
          Hospital</name>, Washington, and transferred to <name type="place">Philadelphia</name>,
        where, on <date type="transfer" when="1863-06-28">June 28th</date>, he was admitted into the
          <name type="hospital">Turners Lane Hospital</name>. Simple dressings and flax-seed
        poultices were applied to the wound. On <date type="injury" when="1863-06-30">June
          30th</date>, there was much pain in the right superior posterior triangle of the neck,
        which was very much inflamed, and discharging freely from an opening in that region. On
          <date type="operation" when="1863-07-02">July 2d</date>, the ball, with adherent piece of
        bone about one inch in length, supposed to be a portion of the inferior maxilla, was
        removed, suppuration and ulceration having taken place around it. Slight h&#230;morrhage
        followed the removal of the ball. On <date type="injury" when="1863-12-12">December
          12th</date>, the wound had entirely healed, and the patient s health was good, though
        there was much chronic enlargement of the right side of the face. He was transferred to the

          1863</date>. Shott is a pensioner. He is very much disfigured. His disability is rated
        total. <name type="person">Pension Examiner Thomas B. Reed</name> reports that he has to use
        an obturator to enable him to speak distinctly. A cast of the head, showing deformity, and

          >Army Medical Museum</name>, and are numbered 1554 and 4518, Sect. I. The case is reported
        by <name type="person">Acting Assistant Surgeon David Burpee</name>, who contributed the
