      Palmer</name>, <name type="organization" key="132">U. S. V.</name>, recorded his admission to
     the field hospital of the 2d division, Second Corps, with "shot fracture of right foot. Treatment of simple dressings."  <date type="transfer" when="1862-12-25">Two weeks after the reception of the
     injury</date> the wounded man was transferred to <name type="hospital" key="176">Lincoln Hospital</name>, Washington, where Syme's
     amputation at the ankle joint was performed, on <date type="operation" when="1862-12-26">December 26th</date>, by <name type="person" key="244">Assistant Surgeon G. M. McGill</name>, <name type="organization" key="190">U. S. A.</name>
     The patient recovered, and was discharged from service <date type="servicedischarge" when="1863-03-02">March 2, 1863</date>, and pensioned. Several years afterwards he was fitted with an

His right leg from the knee down is withered to the bone. The foot was taken off at
     the ankle joint, and there was no cushion left for the end of the bone to rest upon. At times
     the end of the bone is exposed and very painful, and much of the time there is discharge from
     the stump. I have treated him with poor success at various times during the years <date type="pension" when="1872">1872</date>, <date type="pension" when="1873">1873</date>,
      and <date type="pension" when="1874">1874</date>, and have advised an amputation of the limb at the knee, as it would, in my opinion,
     give him less trouble than at present," etc.  The pensioner was paid <date type="pension" when="1881-03-04">March 4, 1881</date>. A part of
     the amputated foot (<hi rend="italic">Spec.</hi> 4859), showing fracture of the <choice><orig>calcaneum</orig><reg>calcaneus</reg></choice> and
     cuboid bone by a conoidal ball, was contributed to <name type="hospital" key="431">the Museum</name> by the operator. </p>
