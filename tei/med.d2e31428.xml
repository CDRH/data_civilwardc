    left elbow joint on the anterior face, and was extracted on <date type="operation" when="1863-06-11">June 11th</date> from the posterior part of the joint, together with several
    fragments of bone. Patient states that erysipelas set in in the latter part of July and terminated in gangrene. The treatment
    of the latter consisted in the application of nitric acid for the first week; but it did not seem to benefit the case, and bromine
    was next used, applied once a day for four days, when the gangrene was arrested. Constitutional treatment consisted of milk
    punch and a good nourishing diet. One piece of bone has been thrown out of the wound of entrance since the operation. This
    piece came out about October 1st. The wound is still discharging a little. The joint is anchylosed at nearly right angles."
