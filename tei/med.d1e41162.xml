The posterior part of the upper lobe of the right lung and the upper portion of the middle lobe were semi-splenified and friable, but did not sink in water; the rest of both lungs was normal. The pericardium contained five drachms of fluid. The heart was normal. The liver and kidneys were congested. The pancreas was whitish and moderately firm. The spleen small and firm. The ileum was very much congested, and presented some punctated ulcers. The large intestine was extensively ulcerated. The mesenteric glands were not enlarged.&#8212;<name type="person" key="245">Assistant Surgeon Harrison Allen</name>, <name type="organization" key="190">U. S. A.</name>&#8432;</p>
   <p>&#8432; September 14, 1864, <name type="person" key="245">Dr. Allen</name> presented to the Pathological Society of Philadelphia a brief &#34;<hi rend="italic">Synopsis of Autopsies made at <name type="hospital" key="176">Lincoln General Hospital</name></hi>,&#34; to which the reader is referred.&#8212;(Proceedings of the Pathological Society of Philadelphia, in the American Journal of the Medical Sciences, January, 1865, page 133.)  In this paper he analyzes the appearances observed in forty-one cases of diarrh&#339;a and dysentery, thirty-five of fever, twenty-one of pneumonia, and five of diphtheria.
