                <p>That your petitioner acquired <seg type="handwritten">her</seg> claim to the

                        under any written evidence of title, make exhibit thereof, or refer to the

                    <seg type="handwritten">to wit; under the Will of her late father <persName>David Clark</persName> formerly of <placeName>Prince George's County Maryland</placeName>, dated the <date when="1792-05-03">3d. May 1792</date>, recorded in said County,
                        and who died in the said year. The negroes claimed for in said list are
                        descendants of those she obtained from her father as aforesaid; all those
                        being now dead. She never obtained any by purchase. Those named in her list
                        have been brought up by her, under her own eye and care. They have all been
                        in her possession for a great many years, indeed from the time they came to
                        her and from their birth. The woman <persName>Rachel Jackson</persName> is
                        the mother and grandmother of all the rest, except <persName>Edmd Stewart</persName>. Her mother came to petitioner under her
                        father's will.</seg></p>

                <p>That your petitioner's claim to the service or labor of said <seg
                        type="handwritten">persons</seg> was, at the time of said discharge
                    therefrom, of the value of <seg type="handwritten">nine thousand one hundred and
                        fifty</seg> dollars in money<seg type="handwritten">,</seg><note
                        type="government" place="foot" xml:id="n3">Here state such facts, if any
                        there be, touching the value of the petitioner's claim to the service or
                        labor of the person, as may enhance the same, and also such facts, if any,
                        touching the moral, mental, and bodily infirmities or defects of said
                        person, as impair the value of the petitioner's claim to such service or
                        labor, and conclude such statement with an averment that the petitioner
                        knows of no other infirmities or defects of said person which impair the
                        value of petitioner's claim to such service or labor, and that he believes
                        none other to exist. If the petitioner specify no such infirmity or defect,
                        then his statement touching the value of his claim should conclude with an
                        averment that he has no knowledge of any such infirmity or
                        defect.</note> <seg type="handwritten">or thereabouts, according to the
                        prices which had been paid in cash for similar negroes by those dealing in
                        them, as she is informed and believes; but being family servants, and
                        brought up by herself, she preferred keeping them. Their value is stated
                        respectively in the said schedule M. A. C. They are healthy, capable and
                        good servants; their morals are good, and they have no mental or bodily
                        infirmity or defect, except <persName>Rachael Hutchens</persName>: (No 7.)
                        She had her arm hurt by the pulling of a cellar door upon it, which has
                        incapacitated her for heavy work, such as washing &#38;c; but she is quite
                        able to attend to house work, and hires out for that purpose. Except the
                        very young ones, and such as she has kept at home for her own use, they have
                        all been regularly hired out, and have kept in their places. <persName>Edmond</persName> and
                                <persName>Nace</persName> have hired themselves out and paid her
                            wages. She knows of no defect, and believes none to exist, except as
                            above. They are valuable servants; and the wages derived from them have
                            been for many years her only means of support. She is now seventy years
                            of age; and unless remunerated for them she would be entirely destitute
                            of the means of living.</seg></p>

                <p>Your petitioner hereby declares that <seg type="handwritten">she</seg> bears true
                    and faithful allegiance to the Government of the <placeName>United

                    arms against the <placeName>United States</placeName> in the present rebellion,
                    nor in any way given aid or comfort thereto.</p>

                <p>And your petitioner further states and alleges, that <seg type="handwritten">she</seg> has not brought said <seg type="handwritten">persons</seg> into

                    <del>was</del> held to service or labor therein under and by virtue of your
                    petitioner's claim to such service or labor.</p>

                <p>Your petitioner further states and alleges, that <seg type="handwritten">her</seg> said claim to the service or labor of said <seg
                        type="handwritten">persons</seg> does not originate in or by virtue of any

                    the present rebellion against the Government of the <placeName>United
                        States</placeName>.</p>

                <p>And your petitioner prays the said Commissioners to investigate and determine the

                    of said <seg type="handwritten">persons</seg> herein above set forth; and if the

                    claim in money, and report the same to the Secretary of the Treasury of the
