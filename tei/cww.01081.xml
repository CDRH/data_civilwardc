                <p>Your letter of the <date when="1862-06-07">7</date> was received a few days ago I should have answered sooner but have not been well in answer to your questions about <persName>George Johnson</persName> he is 36 or 37 years old 5 feet 5 inches in height very dark I might add very black he is humpbacked when he was a boy he was hurt in the back but I believe strong &amp; hearty now or was when I left <placeName>Washington</placeName> I have not seen him for two or three years but I presume he is yet as I have never heard to the contrary I bought him of my father in <date when="1851">1851</date> the bill of sale was witnessed by <persName>B. F. Morsell</persName> the Grocery Merchant and drawn up by <persName>B. K. Morsell</persName> at that time a Magistrate I think the bill of sale is recorded at the City Hall</p>
                <p>Judging from what I hired him for I think I can safely say he is worth $250 he is a good waiter or porter I hired him to Mr. <persName>B F Morsell</persName> also to Mr. <persName>B Hall</persName> the Grocer he formerly worked on the farm and was a good hand he was honest and faithful &amp; truthful as far as I know</p>

                <p>In forming my opinion as to his value I base my Judgement for what I hired him for I never hired him for less than $10 per month very often $12 to 15 per month I think I have answered all of your questions as far as I know you can inquire of either of those Gentlemen I have named about <persName>George</persName> I asked <persName>Mr Barchus</persName> to look after <persName>George</persName> as I have not heard from him for two or three months I did not know <choice><sic>wether</sic><corr>whether</corr></choice> he was living or dead but I suppose if he is dead I should of learned it</p>
