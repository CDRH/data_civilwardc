   <p><hi rend="initialcap">C</hi>ASE 257.&#8212;<name type="person" key="959">Corporal Henry C.
     Sennett</name>, <name type="organization" key="114">Co. F, 122d New York</name>, aged 27 years,
    was wounded in front of <name type="BATTLE" key="xxx">Petersburg</name>, <date type="injury"
     when="1865-03-27">March 27, 1865</date>, by a conoidal musket ball, which entered midway
    between the anterior superior spinous process of the ilium and the trochanter major, and lodged
    in the head of the left femur. The patient was removed to <name type="place" key="#Washington"
     >Washington</name>, and, on <date type="admit" when="1865-04-02">April 2d</date>, was admitted
    to <name type="hospital" key="165">Mount Pleasant Hospital</name>. He was feverish and fretful,
    and his tongue was furred; but the wound had a healthy aspect, and there was but little swelling
    or deformity of the limb. But exploration with the finger proved that the ball had penetrated
    the hip joint. On <date type="operation" when="1865-04-04">April 4th</date> the patient being
    an&#230;sthetized by an equal mixture of chloroform arid ether, <name type="person" key="245"
     >Assistant Surgeon H. Allen</name>, <name type="organization" key="190">U. S. A.</name>, made a
    T-shaped incision, four inches by six inches, over the trochanter major, and excised the head
    and neck of the femur. The head was fractured into three pieces, and the ball was embedded in
    it. Violent hiccough came on immediately after the operation and continued through the night,
    but was finally arrested by the persistent use of antispasmodics. On April 5th and 6th there was
    great <choice>
     <sic>tympanitis</sic>
     <corr>tympanites</corr>
    </choice>, the bowels being obstinately constipated. An enema of castor oil was administered
    without effect, and in two hours another of molasses and water and salt, which induced a slight
    evacuation. Singultus again recurred. On April 7th the bowels moved freely. A chill occurred,
    lasting half an hour. There was great abdominal tenderness on pressure, and other well marked
    symptoms of peritonitis. On <date type="death" when="1865-04-08">the 8th</date> the hiccough
    continued; the abdomen became greatly distended; the countenance became pinched and ghastly, and
    the patient died at ten at night. At the autopsy, made twelve hours after death, the lungs were
    found healthy; the liver greatly hypertrophied; the lower fifth of the ilium inflamed and
    injected. The tissues surrounding the hip joint were in a sloughing condition, and were
    infiltrated with fetid pus, which had burrowed several inches under the gluteal muscles and two
    inches below the trochanter minor. The acetabulum was denuded and slightly fractured at its
    upper and posterior border. Two inches of the upper extremity of the shaft of the femur was
    denuded of periosteum. The specimen was presented by <name type="person" key="245">Dr.
     Allen</name> to the <name type="hospital" key="431">Army Medical Museum</name>, and is
    represented in the adjoining wood-cut (<hi rend="initialcap">F</hi>IG. 65). The innominate bone
    was not removed; but the upper fourth of the femur was sawn off after death, and mounted with
    the excised head to show how completely the injury to the femur was limited to the epiphysis.
    Had it not been for the fracture of the pelvis, it would have been difficult to have found a
    case better adapted for the operation of primary excision.</p>
