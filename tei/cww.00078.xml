                        the value of his claim should conclude with an averment that he has no

                    the present rebellion, nor in any way given aid or comfort thereto.</p>

                <p>And your petitioner further states and alleges, that <seg type="handwritten"
                        >he</seg> has not brought said <seg type="handwritten"><persName>Rachel

                    of said act of Congress; and that, at the time of the passage thereof, said <seg

                <p>Your petitioner further states and alleges, that <seg type="handwritten"

                    the United States.</p>

                <p>And your petitioner prays the said Commissioners to investigate and determine the

                    herein above set forth; and if the same be found to be valid, that they appraise
                    and apportion the value of said claim in money, and report the same to the
                    Secretary of the Treasury of the United States, in conformity to the provisions
