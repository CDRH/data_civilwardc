   <p><hi rend="initialcap">C</hi>ASE 1795.&#8212;<name type="person" key="xxx">Private C. H. Gove</name>, <name type="organization" key="xxx">Co. I, 145th New York</name>, aged 18 years, was wounded at <name type="BATTLE"  key="10">Chancellorsville</name>, <date type="injury" when="1863-05-03">May 3, 1863</date>, by a mini&#233; ball, which entered the anterior aspect of the forearm above the middle, and made its exit through the olecranon process. On <date type="operation" when="1863-05-08">May 8th</date>, resection of the olecranon process (and probably of the articular extremities of the humerus, radius, and ulna, as the interspace between the ends of the bones was very considerable) was performed on the field by a Confederate surgeon; and an angular splint was applied, with cold-water dressings.  Gove was a prisoner for thirteen days after he was wounded; but in <date type="transfer" when="1863-06">June</date> was sent to <name type="place" key="#Washington">Washington</name>, was treated at <name type="hospital" key="165">Mount Pleasant Hospital</name>, and thence transferred to <name type="hospital" key="xxx">Satterlee Hospital, Philadelphia</name>, where he was received <date type="transfer" when="1863-06-21">June 21st</date>.  <name type="person" key="xxx">Acting Assistant Surgeon T. G. Morton</name> reported that &#34;the wound was then sloughing; the use of the splint and cerate dressing was continued for about three weeks, when the splint was removed.  The wound nearly healed, leaving the joint with its movement impaired and the arm semi-flexed,&#34; and the patient was discharged the service <date type="servicedischarge" when="1863-11-21">November 21, 1863</date>, and pensioned.  <name type="person" key="xxx">Mr. Gove</name> visited the <name type="hospital" key="431">Army Medical Museum</name> <date type="photo" when="1873-02-03">February 3, 1873</date>, and a photograph, represented by the cut (<hi rend="initialcap">F</hi>IG. 618), was then taken. A memorandum made at the time states that there was good use of the hand and very fair use of the forearm.  <name type="person" key="xxx">Examiner H. L. Dodge</name>, of <name type="place">Boston</name>, reported, <date type="pension" when="1863-11-24">November 24, 1863</date>: &#34;There is great separation between the bonus of the arm and the forearm.&#34;  <name type="person" key="xxx">Examiner G. S. Jones</name> reported, <date type="pension" when="1866-10-06">October 6, 1866</date>: &#34;The forearm is powerless and useless.&#34;  The last examination of the pensioner was made under <name type="person" key="xxx">Surgeon Thomas Franklin Smith</name>, of <name type="place">New York</name>, <date type="pension" when="1873-09-17">September 17, 1873</date>, who reported: &#34;Complete resection of the right elbow joint. The hand hangs to the side, and for purposes of manual labor the disability is equal to the loss of the arm.&#34;  Pensioner was paid <date type="pension" when="1874-03-04">March 4, 1874</date>.</p>
