     type="organization" key="542">Co. G, 1st Oregon</name>, aged 35 years, was frost-bitten in his
    feet and hands while on march between Owyhee and Malheur rivers, Idaho, <date type="injury"
     when="1865-12-17">December 17, 1865</date>. He was conveyed to <name type="hospital" key="xx"
     >Camp Auburn</name>, where portions of the lower limbs were amputated by <name type="person"
     key="xx">Acting Assistant Surgeon M. V. Amen</name> on <date type="operation" when="1866-01-17"
     >January 17, 1866</date>. The patient recovered, and was mustered out of service <date
     type="servicedischarge" when="1866-04-14">April 14, 1866</date>, and pensioned. Having been
    sent East, after receiving his discharge from service, for the purpose of being provided with
    artificial limbs, he was admitted to the <name type="hospital" key="89">Post Hospital</name> at
    Washington on <date type="admit" when="1867-02-02">February 2, 1867</date>, whence <name
     type="person" key="200">Assistant Surgeon W. Thomson</name>, <name type="organization"
     key="190">U. S. A.</name>, described the case as follows: "The operation seems to have been
    Chopart's, on the right foot, which had entirely healed when the patient was admitted. The stump
    was firm and well formed, but so sensitive for the space of one and a half inches from the
    cicatrix that the man desired the limb to be removed at a point above the ankle. The amputation
    of the left leg had been performed about six inches above the ankle and had failed to close from
    the presence of a ligature. After this was removed the stump healed entirely. The patient had
    also lost portions of the phalanges of both hands from the same cause. On <date type="pension"
     when="1867-05-22">May 22, 1867</date>, he was furnished transportation to <name type="place"
     >New York City</name> to be fitted with artificial limbs." These were supplied by the firm of
     <name type="organization" key="xx">Monroe and Gardiner</name>. Re-amputation of the stump of
    the left leg subsequently became necessary and was performed by <name type="person" key="xx"
     >Professor F. H. Hamilton</name>, at <name type="hospital" key="xx">Bellevue Hospital</name>,
    on <date type="operation" when="1868-11-09">November 9, 1868</date>. Several years later, when
    the pensioner was supplied with artificial limbs by <name type="person" key="xx">D. W.
     Kolbe</name>, of <name type="place" key="xx">Philadelphia</name>, both stumps were reported as
    being in a sound condition. The pensioner was paid <date type="pension" when="1881-12-04"
     >December 4, 1881</date>. Casts of the stump of the foot and of the leg were prepared at the
     <name type="hospital" key="431">Army Medical Museum</name>, and constitute specimens 4128 and
    4191, respectively, of the <hi rend="italic">Surgical Section</hi>. The latter is represented in
    the annexed wood-cut (<hi rend="initialcap">F</hi>IG. 371) and apparently shows the amputation
    to have been performed by the posterior flap-method.&#185;</p>
