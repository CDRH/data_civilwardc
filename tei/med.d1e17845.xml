                                                  right tonsil, and lodged apparently in the deeper
                                                  muscles of the neck, in the region of the great vessels.

The treatment consisted of Dover's

                                                  several times, with inflammation of the tonsils
                                                  and fauces, accompanied by tenderness of the right

                                                  trapezius. He suffered intensely from pain of the
                                                  right side of the face and ear, occasioning high
