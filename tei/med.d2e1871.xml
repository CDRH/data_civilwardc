      Briggs</name>, <name type="organization" key="340">Co. A, 102d Pennsylvania</name>, aged 27
     years, was wounded at <name type="BATTLE" key="257">Chancellorsville</name>, <date
      type="injury" when="1863-05-03">May 3, 1863</date>. <name type="person" key="243">Assistant
      Surgeon J. C. McKee</name>, <name type="organization" key="190">U. S. A.</name>, in charge of
     the General Hospital at <name type="place" key="xx">Pittsburgh</name>, reported the
     following history: &#34;The ball passed between the tibia and fibula, about the middle of the leg, escaping through the calf opposite the point of entrance.
     The patient was four days at <name type="hospital" key="xx">Falmouth Hospital</name>, seven
     days at <name type="hospital" key="162">Douglas</name>, Washington, and was then removed to
     <name type="hospital" key="xx">Satterlee, Philadelphia</name>. <date type="furlough" when="1863-06-01">Seventeen days after his
      admission</date> to the latter he was furloughed and came to <name type="place">Pittsburgh</name>. The wound had healed at its
     entrance and was still discharging at its exit, but was considered fit to travel with. He had
     several slight chills before leaving Philadelphia, and one of a more severe character after his
     arrival home, followed by h&#230;morrhage from the posterior wound, which was arrested. <date type="admit" when="1863-06-03">The next day</date> he came to the hospital.
     The wound presented the unmistakable evidence of gangrene. He was isolated, and nitric acid was
     freely applied to all parts. The disease was found very extensive, involving the greater part
     of the calf of the leg. Poultices of charcoal and pyroligneous acid, etc., were applied. The
     constitutional remedies were quinia, muriated tincture of iron, stimulants, beef-tea, etc. The
     disease was checked, and the patient is (July 31st) recovering rapidly. The interest in this
     case is the distance the man carried the contagion, the great rapidity and destructiveness of
     its attack, apparently uninfluenced by the comforts of a good home and the best of food and
     nursing.&#34; The patient remained in the hospital until <date type="servicedischarge" when="1864-09-03"
      >September 3, 1864</date>, when he was mustered out, his term of service having expired. The
     <name type="organization" key="xx">Pittsburgh Examining Board</name> certified, in <date type="pension" when="1873">1873</date> and
     <date type="pension" when="1873">1875</date>, that there was wasting of the gastrocnemius muscle from gangrene, and that the resulting
     adhesions have impaired the action of that muscle and cause pain in the ankle. The pensioner
     was paid <date type="pension" when="1876-06-04">June 4, 1876</date>. </p>
