                        <lb/> to wit:</dateline>
                    <p>On this <date when="1863-01-12">12th day of January A.D. 1863</date>,
                        personally appeared Mrs. <persName>Elizabeth Fechtig</persName>, and under
                        oath deposes and says: I have been well acquainted with Mrs. <persName>Sarah
                            A. Abbott</persName> and her husband <persName>Charles
                        Abbott</persName>, for many years, and have always been intimate with
                            <persName>Mrs. Abbott</persName> both before and after her marriage.
                        While <persName>Mrs. Abbott</persName> was single and unmarried, the slave
                        woman <persName>Leah Dorman</persName> was understood to be her sole and
                        separate property, and the hire for her services was paid to my father, by
                        the persons hiring her, for the use and benefit of <persName>Mrs.
                            Abbott</persName>. After <persName>Mrs. Abbott</persName> was married
                        and for nearly two years thereafter, the same action was had, Mr.
                            <persName>Joseph Libbey</persName> of <placeName>Georgetown</placeName>
                        (who then had <persName>Leah</persName> in his service having hired her)
                        regularly paying to my father, the monthly hire of said
                            <persName>Leah</persName>, which my father received, and paid over to
                            <persName>Mrs. Abbott</persName>, regularly without reference to, or by
                        virtue of any order, whatever, from <persName>Mr. Abbott</persName>.</p>
                    <p>It was not until <persName>Mrs. Abbott</persName>, having occasion for
                            <persName>Leah's</persName> services as nurse, that
                            <persName>Leah</persName> ever lived with <persName>Mrs.
                            Abbott</persName>, and the hiring and paying over was discontinued. I am
                        aware of all these facts from my own knowledge, and I know moreover, that
                            <persName>Mr. Abbott</persName> never pretended or claimed to own or
                        control said <persName>Leah Dorman</persName>.</p>
