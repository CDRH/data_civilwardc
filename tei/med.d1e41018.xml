The right lung weighed twenty-five ounces, the left twenty-one; six pints of serum were taken from the pleural cavities; all the lobes of both lungs contained miliary tubercles, which were most abundant in their posterior portions; the lower lobes were hypostatically congested. The bronchial glands were tuberculous. The heart was soft, flabby, and weighed ten ounces; it was surrounded by a moderate quantity of adipose tissue; the heart-clots weighed one ounce and a quarter. The pericardium contained eight ounces of serum. The liver weighed eighty-seven ounces; it was of a brownish-purple color, mottled, its acini distinct, and had miliary tubercles on its surface; the gall-bladder was empty. The spleen weighed twelve ounces and a half; it was of a dark-purple color, and had miliary tubercles both on its surface and internally. The pancreas weighed three ounces and a quarter. The suprarenal capsules were large, soft, and coffee-colored. The right kidney weighed nine ounces and three quarters, the left eleven ounces and a half; both of them were light colored, friable, and slightly congested inferiorly. The stomach was large, its rug&#230; prominent. The mucous membrane of the duodenum was congested and softened. There was irregular congestion of the lower fourth of the jejunum, and the whole of the ileum, alternating with slate-colored patches. The valvul&#230; conniventes were indistinct; the mucous membrane thin; the solitary follicles enlarged. The large intestine was dilated, its walls thin, its mucous membrane bluish and softened. There were several ulcers, each about the size of a three-cent piece, in the colon and rectum. On the peritoneal surface of the intestines were numerous miliary tubercles, which were particularly conspicuous in positions corresponding to the patches of Peyer.&#8212;<name type="person" key="244">Assistant Surgeon George M.
