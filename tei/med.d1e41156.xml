   <p><hi rend="initialcap">C</hi>ASE 389.—<name type="person" key="xxx">Sergeant James H. Morse</name>, <name type="organization" key="xxx">company D, 8th Pennsylvania cavalry</name>; admitted <date type="admit" when="1863-09-17">September 17, 1863</date>.  Quotidian intermittent fever and chronic diarrhœa.

The posterior parts of the meninges were considerably congested; the brain was firm, and weighed forty-eight ounces and a half; the ventricles contained a drachm of serum. The œsophagus was pale throughout; the larynx and trachea were also pale; at the bifurcation of the trachea there was a quantity of bronchial secretion. The right lung weighed twenty-three ounces; the anterior and superior portions of its upper lobe were healthy, the posterior and inferior portions hepatized; the lower lobe was partly carnified, partly splenified; the left lung was healthy, and weighed sixteen ounces. The pericardium contained five drachms and a half of fluid resembling the white of an egg. The heart weighed eleven ounces and a half; a very small whitish-yellow clot, the size of a horse-chestnut, was found in the right side, one of similar dimensions and appearance in the left side; the valves were healthy. The liver had the nutmeg appearance, was quite fatty, and weighed sixty-three ounces; the gall-bladder contained two ounces and a half of dark-green bile, in which there was considerable sediment of an intense green color. The spleen was somewhat softer than usual, of a dark-purple color, and weighed twelve ounces and a half. The pancreas was firm, white, and weighed three ounces. The kidneys were pale and apparently fatty; the right weighed six ounces, the left six and a half. The intestines were bound together and to the abdominal parietes by fibrinous bands; the mucous membrane of the small intestine was healthy to within two feet of the cæcum; Peyer's patches and the solitary glands were not prominent; the large intestine was ulcerated throughout, most of the ulcers being punctated; they were most marked along the longitudinal bands.—<name type="person" key="245">Assistant Surgeon Harrison Allen</name>, <name type="organization" key="190">U.

In this paper he analyzes the appearances observed in forty-one cases of diarrhœa and dysentery, thirty-five of fever, twenty-one of pneumonia, and five of diphtheria. The notes of <name type="person" key="245">Dr. Allen</name>'s autopsies, from which the accounts here presented have been condensed, were not contained in the case-books of <name type="hospital" key="176">Lincoln hospital</name> turned in to the <name type="organization" key="xxx">Surgeon General's Office</name> at the close of the war, but have since been copied into them from the originals, loaned for the purpose.</p>
