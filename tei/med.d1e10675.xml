                                        affected for a week or two with cough. He had an abundant
                                        expectoration and well-marked symptoms of bronchitis.  On the
                                        12th his throat became slightly sore, the fauces somewhat
                                        reddened, tonsils enlarged and cervical glands swollen. A
                                        gargle was prescribed.  Two days later he had a little
                                        diarrh&#339;a but the throat was better.  About noon of <date type="death" when="1865-02-17">the 17th</date>
                                        he was suddenly seized with great dyspn&#339;a, his lips
                                        becoming quite blue, when, on examination, the uvula,
                                        epiglottis and glottis were found to be &#339;dematous.
                                        Scarification gave some relief, but an emetic, which was
                                        administered, was without effect. At 5 P. M. the patient
                                        again became threatened with suffocation, which scarification and inhalation of hot vapor and of acetic acid and
                                        ether failed to relieve.  Laryngotomy was performed <date type="operation" when="1865-02-17">at 7 P.

                                        patient took two or three inspirations, coughed up a few
                                        drops of blood, and died.  <hi rend="italic">Post-mortem</hi> examination: The
                                        chink of the glottis was completely closed by &#339;dema of the
                                        surrounding tissue.  [<hi rend="italic">Specimen</hi> 519, Med. Sec., <name type="hospital" key="431">Army Medical Museum</name>.]  The epiglottis was &#339;dematous and much thickened.
                                        The trachea and bronchial tubes were inflamed, their mucous
                                        membrane thickened and reddened to their minute subdivisions; no false membrane was found in any part of the
                                        air-passages. A small patch of pneumonia was discovered in the lower part of the left lung. The other organs were
