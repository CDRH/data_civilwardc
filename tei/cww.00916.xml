                <p rend="bold">To the Commissioners under the act of Congress approved the <date when="1862-04-16">16th of April, 1862</date>, entitled "An act for the

                <p>Your Petitioner, <seg type="handwritten"><persName>Josiah Burgess</persName>,
                        (colored)</seg> of <seg type="handwritten"><placeName>Washington City
                        </placeName></seg> by this <seg type="handwritten">his</seg> petition in
                    writing, represents and states, that <seg type="handwritten">he</seg> is a
                    person loyal to the <placeName>United States</placeName>, who, at the time of
                    the passage of the said act of Congress, held a claim to service or labor
                    against <seg type="handwritten">one male</seg> person of African descent of the
                    name of <seg type="handwritten"><persName>William Thompson</persName></seg> for
                    and during the life of said <seg type="handwritten"><persName>William
                            Thompson</persName>,</seg> and that by said act of Congress said <seg type="handwritten"><persName>William Thompson</persName> was</seg>
                    discharged and freed of and from all claim of your petitioner to such service or
                    labor; that at the time of said discharge said <seg type="handwritten">
                        <persName>William Thompson</persName></seg> was of the age of <seg type="handwritten">about 21 years,</seg> and of the personal description
                        following:<note type="government" place="foot" xml:id="n1">Here describe the
                        person, so as to identify him or her; and if there be more than one slave,
                        describe each one separately.</note>
                    <seg type="handwritten"> About five feet six or seven inches high, dark brown
                        color, slim made, and healthy and strong.</seg></p>

                <pb xml:id="leaf001v" facs="cww.00916.002.jpg"/>
                <p>That your petitioner acquired <seg type="handwritten">his</seg> claim to the
                    aforesaid service or labor of said <seg type="handwritten"><persName>William
                            Thompson</persName>,</seg> in manner following:<note type="government" place="foot" xml:id="n2">Here state how the claim was acquired, when, from
                        whom, and for what price or consideration; and, if held under any written
                        evidence of title, make exhibit thereof, or refer to the public record where
                        the same may be found.</note>
                    <seg type="handwritten">About 17 years ago, when the said boy was about four
                        years old, he appeared to be unhealthy, and his master, Mr. <persName>George
                            Parker</persName> refused to pay his board and told the colored woman
                        who boarded the boy that any person who would pay the board might have the
                        said boy, whereupon I paid the board and have owned and supported the boy
                        ever since, he working for me.</seg></p>

                <p>That your petitioner's claim to the service or labor of said <seg type="handwritten"><persName>William Thompson</persName></seg> was, at the
                    time of said discharge therefrom, of the value of <seg type="handwritten">five
                        hundred</seg> dollars in money.<note type="government" place="foot" xml:id="n3">Here state such facts, if any there be, touching the value of
                        the petitioner's claim to the service or labor of the person, as may enhance
                        the same, and also such facts, if any, touching the moral, mental, and
                        bodily infirmities or defects of said person, as impair the value of the
                        petitioner's claim to such service or labor, and conclude such statement
                        with an averment that the petitioner knows of no other infirmities or
                        defects of said person which impair the value of petitioner's claim to such
                        service or labor, and that he believes none other to exist. If the
                        petitioner specify no such infirmity or defect, then his statement touching
                        the value of his claim should conclude with an averment that he has no
                        knowledge of any such infirmity or defect.</note><seg type="handwritten">Being strong and healthy and steady, I consider him worth as much as young
                        men of his age generally are. I know of no moral, mental, or bodily defects
                        to impair his value, and do not believe that any such exist. I have no
                        papers to prove my title and do not know of any public record where the same
                        may be found.</seg></p>

                <p>Your petitioner hereby declares that <seg type="handwritten">he</seg> bears true
                    and faithful allegiance to the Government of the <placeName>United
                        States</placeName>, and that <seg type="handwritten">he</seg> has not borne
                    arms against the <placeName>United States</placeName> in the present rebellion,
                    nor in any way given aid or comfort thereto.</p>

                <p>And your petitioner further states and alleges, that <seg type="handwritten">he</seg> has not brought said <seg type="handwritten"><persName>William
                            Thompson</persName></seg> into the <placeName>District of
                        Columbia</placeName> since the passage of said act of Congress; and that, at
                    the time of the passage thereof, said <seg type="handwritten"><persName>Wm.
                            Thompson</persName></seg> was held to service or labor therein under and
                    by virtue of your petitioner's claim to such service or labor.</p>

                <p>Your petitioner further states and alleges, that <seg type="handwritten">his</seg> said claim to the service or labor of said <seg type="handwritten"><persName>William Thompson</persName></seg> does not
                    originate in or by virtue of any transfer heretofore made by any person who has
                    in any manner aided or sustained the present rebellion against the Government of
                    the <placeName>United States</placeName>.</p>

                <p>And your petitioner prays the said Commissioners to investigate and determine the
                    validity of <seg type="handwritten">his</seg> said claim to the service or labor
                    of said <seg type="handwritten"><persName>William Thompson</persName>,</seg>
                    herein above set forth; and if the same be found to be valid, that they appraise
                    and apportion the value of said claim in money, and report the same to the
                    Secretary of the Treasury of the <placeName>United States</placeName>, in
                    conformity to the provisions of said act of Congress.</p>
