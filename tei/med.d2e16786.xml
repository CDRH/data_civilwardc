      Thomas</name>, <name type="organization" key="484">Co. A, 17th Infantry</name>, aged 19 years,
     was wounded at <name type="BATTLE" key="127">Bull Run</name>, <date type="injury"
      when="1862-08-29">August 29, 1862</date>, receiving a shot fracture of the upper third of the
     right leg.  <name type="person" key="930">Assistant Surgeon B. Howard</name>, <name type="organization" key="190">U. S. A.</name>, reported that he amputated the leg on the field, on <date type="operation" when="1862-09-01">September 1st</date>, at the knee joint, including the removal of the patella in the operation, which was performed by the double flap method. <date type="admit" when="1862-09">Several days after
     the date of the injury</date> the wounded man was removed to <name type="place" key="#Washington">Washington</name> and admitted to <name
      type="hospital" key="64">Ascension Hospital</name>, whence <name type="person" key="1117">Surgeon J. C. Dorr</name>, <name type="organization" key="132">U. S. V.</name>, described his
     case as follows: "After his admission, the sutures were found upon examination to have given
     away and the flaps were gaping. The patient had been much exhausted by long marching prior to
     the battle, and it was feared that he would not survive the effects of the operation.
     Stimulants, beef tea, and quinine were freely given, and finally, after repeated relapses, he
     has now (December 3d) nearly recovered, the stump being covered with fine granulations, and his
     strength having recuperated to its normal standard." The patient subsequently passed through
      <name type="hospital" key="167">Carver</name> and <name type="hospital" key="160">St. Elizabeth Hospital</name>s, and on <date type="hospitaldischarge" when="1863-06-16">June 16,
      1863</date>, he was discharged, having been previously furnished with an artificial leg. He
     afterwards entered the <name type="organization" key="109">Veteran Reserve Corps</name>, and
     was ultimately discharged from service <date type="servicedischarge" when="1864-04-05">April 5,
      1864</date>, and pensioned. He was paid <date type="pension" when="1880-03-04">March 4, 1880</date>. In his application for commutation he
     reported the stump as being in a good condition. </p>
