   <p>Case from the case-book of the <name type="hospital" key="501"><hi rend="initialcap">T</hi>HIRD <hi rend="initialcap">D</hi>IVISION</name> of the <name type="place" key="#Alexandria"><hi rend="initialcap">A</hi>LEXANDRIA</name> <hi rend="initialcap">H</hi>OSPITAL, <name type="person" key="134">Surgeon Edwin Bentley</name>, <name type="organization" key="132">U.

   <p><hi rend="initialcap">C</hi>ASE 528.&#8212;<name type="person" key="xxx">Private William Johnson</name>, <name type="organization" key="xxx">company C, 48th Pennsylvania volunteers</name>; admitted <date type="admit" when="1864-10-21">October 21, 1864</date>.  Chronic diarrh&#339;a.  [This man appears on the register of the depot hospital of the 9th Corps, <name type="place">City Point, Virginia</name>, admitted <date type="admit" when="1864-10-01">October 1st</date>&#8212;debility&#8212;sent to general hospital <date type="transfer" when="1864-10-20">October 20th</date>, per hospital transport Ben Deford.]  The patient was very feeble, and had copious frequent stools, the discharges being thin and clay-colored. Blue mass combined with opium was given for a time, followed by mineral and vegetable astringents combined with opium, and, as the patient became weaker, gentle tonics and stimulants. Opiate and astringent enemata were frequently given to relieve the pain and tenesmus. His appetite gradually failed; he grew steadily weaker, and died <date type="death" when="1865-02-08">February 8, 1865</date>.  <hi rend="italic">Autopsy</hi> <date type="autopsy" when="1865-02-09">eighteen hours after death</date>: Slight suggillation posteriorly; rigor mortis moderate. There were pleuritic adhesions on the left side. Both lungs were congested, and a bloody serosity exuded on section. The bronchial glands were enlarged. The stomach was normal. The mucous membrane of the jejunum presented patches of ulceration. The ileum was ulcerated as far as the ileo-c&#230;cal valve. In the colon there were patches of bluish ulceration and discolorations, supposed to be cicatrices. The spleen was small. The kidneys were small but normal.</p> 
   <p>&#8432; It is to be regretted that, in most instances, the records of this hospital do not show by whom the autopsies were made. It is known that many of them were made by <name type="person" key="134">Surgeon Bentley</name> himself, or under his immediate supervision, but it is only possible to distinguish these from the others in a few cases.</p>
