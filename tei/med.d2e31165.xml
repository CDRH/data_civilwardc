G, 6th Maine</name>, aged 18 years, was wounded at <name type="BATTLE" key="15">Rappahannock Station</name>, <date type="injury" when="1863-11-07">November 7, 1863</date>, by a conoidal ball, which entered the left shoulder posteriorly, two inches from the acromion process, fractured the upper extremity of the humerus, and made its exit an inch and a half below the middle of the clavicle.  He was sent to <name type="place" key="#Washington">Washington</name>, and received at <name type="hospital" key="171">Armory Square Hospital</name>.  <name type="person" key="123">Surgeon D. W. Bliss</name>, <name type="organization" key="132">U. S. V.</name>, reported: &#34;A ball, supposed to be conoidal. entered posteriorly two inches from the acromion process, passing through the head of the humerus, fracturing off the upper two-thirds of the head of the bone comminuting the inner portions and about two inches of the shall of the humerus. Exit one and a half inches below the clavicle, at the middle third.  <date type="operation" when="1863-11-10">November 10th</date>, head of the humerus and about two inches of the shaft <choice><orig>exsected</orig><reg>excised</reg></choice>; the S-incision made through the soft parts; ordinary h&#230;morrhage; patient under chloroform. No vessels required ligation. The patient came out of the an&#230;sthetic well. At the time of operation, the parts were swollen and ecchymosed; his constitutional condition was good, but he was somewhat feverish.  The patient made a good recovery.&#34;  <name type="person" key="123">The operator</name> transmitted the pathological specimen (<hi rend="initialcap">F</hi>IG. 430) to the <name type="hospital" key="431">Army Medical Museum</name>.  <name type="person" key="xxx">This officer</name> was furloughed <date type="furlough" when="1864-01-12">January 12, 1864</date>, and, returning to <name type="place" key="#Washington">Washington</name>, was treated in quarters, by <name type="person" key="156">Surgeon T. Antisell</name>, <name type="organization" key="132">U. S. V.</name>  On <date type="servicedischarge" when="1864-05-28">May 28, 1864</date>, the wound had healed, and <name type="person" key="xxx">Lieutenant Jacobs</name> was discharged from service (S. O. 190, A. G. O.), and pensioned.  <name type="person" key="xxx">Examiner A. G. Peabody</name>, of <name type="place">Machias, Maine</name>, reported substantially the facts already detailed regarding the injury and operation.  <name type="person" key="xxx">Mr. Jacobs</name> was subsequently employed in the <name type="organization" key="xxx">office of the Commissary General of Subsistence</name>. In <date type="photo" when="1866-01">January, 1866</date>, he called at <name type="hospital" key="431">the Museum</name>, and a photograph was taken of the injured shoulder. It is represented by the first figure in <hi rend="initialcap">P</hi>LATE <hi rend="initialcap">XIV</hi>, opposite page 529. At that time his control over the mutilated arm was more complete than in any other case of excision of the upper extremity of the humerus for shot injury that had come under observation at <name type="hospital" key="431">the Museum</name>. He could put his hand on the top of his head and could lift a heavy weight. The amount of shortening was precisely three inches. The favorable result thus happily achieved was lasting; for, in <date type="pension" when="1875-01">January, 1875</date>, <name type="person" key="xxx">Mr. Jacobs</name> could use his arm even better than ten years before, and was on duty in the <name type="organization" key="xxx">Treasury Department</name>. His general health was excellent, and his control over the movements of the left arm was so perfect, that by any but a close professional observer the mutilation he had undergone would be unnoticed.</p>
