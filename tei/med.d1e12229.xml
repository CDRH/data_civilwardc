                    conoidal ball, which fractured the upper portion of the right frontal bone.  He

                    dressings only were required.  On <date type="transfer" when="1865-05-29">May

                            1868</date>, says, that since his examination in <date type="pension" when="1867-07">July, 1867</date>, the patient's general
                    health had greatly failed, which he attributed to continued pain in the head,
                    producing nervousness and drowsiness. The action of the heart was violent and
                    excessive, and, for six months, there were symptoms of ascites, which diminished
                    under treatment. He was a night watchman in a mill, but lost much time. His
                    disability was then rated seven-eighths, and probably permanent.</p>
