                                        fever, presenting a quick strong pulse, 100, continuous
                                        headache, a red and slightly coated tongue and capricious
                                        appetite. Dover's powder was given. The patient vomited
                                        during the night; next day the tongue was dry, red at the
                                        edges and brown in the centre, and the teeth covered with
                                        sordes. Turpentine emulsion was given every two hours, with
                                        small doses of opium, ipecacuanha and nitre. On October 2
                                        wine and cinchona were ordered in repeated doses; at night
                                        the patient perspired a little. On the 3d the skin was of
                                        natural temperature and presented some rose-colored spots,
                                        which were perceptible to the touch and disappeared on
                                        pressure; the bowels, which had been quiet since admission,
                                        were on this day moved four times. He rested well at night,
                                        and on the 4th had a natural skin, moist and slightly brown
                                        tongue and feeble pulse, 90 per minute; three stools were
                                        passed. During the following week the patient continued
                                        without much change. On the 5th there was some ringing in
                                        the left ear, with slight headache on the following day; on
                                        the 10th marked deafness with tinnitus aurium. The bowels
                                        were somewhat relaxed at this time, the pulse from 80 to
                                        100, the skin natural and the tongue brownish and inclined
                                        to be dry or, occasionally, moist and yellow-coated except
                                        at the edges, which were red. On the 11th fifteen grains of
                                        quinine, with six of blue-pill and two of opium, were given
                                        in two doses at an interval of two hours, with four grains
                                        of quinine every two hours thereafter. During the night
                                        profuse sweating occurred, and next day there was no stool.
