   <p>Case from the case-book of <name type="hospital" key="176"><hi rend="initialcap">L</hi>INCOLN <hi rend="initialcap">H</hi>OSPITAL</name>, Washington, D. C.; <name type="person" key="242">Assistant Surgeon Roberts Bartholow</name>, <name type="organization" key="190">U. S. A.</name>, in charge from August 21st to December, 1863.</p>
   <p><hi rend="initialcap">C</hi>ASE 385.&#8212;<name type="person" key="xxx">Private Joseph Gerrold</name>, <name type="organization" key="xxx">company E, 10th Vermont volunteers</name>; admitted <date type="admit" when="1863-11-23">November 23, 1863</date>.  Chronic diarrh&#339;a.  Died, <date type="death" when="1863-11-29">November 29th</date>.  <hi rend="italic">Autopsy:</hi> Height five feet eight inches; rigor mortis slight; body emaciated. The brain was healthy, and weighed forty-seven ounces; the ventricles contained two drachms of fluid. The epiglottis had a yellowish-pink color. The mucous membrane of the larynx was of a bluish cast; that of the trachea was purplish over the interspaces, whitish over the rings. The right lung weighed twenty-one ounces; the posterior portion of its upper and lower lobes was congested, the rest of the lung healthy; the left lung weighed twenty-four ounces; it was intensely congested, and the central portion of the base of its upper lobe was in the stage of red hepatization. The pericardium contained a drachm of bloody fluid. The heart and its valves were healthy; there was a large whitish clot in its right side extending into the pulmonary artery; in the left side there was a smaller clot of the same character. The liver was congested; the gall-bladder contained four drachms of slightly viscid brown-red bile. The spleen was seven inches long, by five and a quarter wide and three and a half thick; it had a dark purplish mahogany-color, and was very firm. The kidneys were pale, the left being paler than the right; the right kidney weighed six ounces, the left five and a half. The pancreas weighed two ounces. The small intestine was extremely congested; large intestine the same; the mucous membrane of the large intestine was of a dark-greenish color. The diagnosis recorded in this case was chronic diarrh&#339;a, but none of the characteristic lesions of that disease were found. There was no ulceration, no intumescence of the solitary glands, &#38;c. The patient died most probably of pneumonia.&#8212;<name type="person" key="245">Assistant Surgeon Harrison Allen</name>, <name type="organization" key="190">U. S. A.</name>&#8432;</p>
   <p>&#8432; September 14, 1864, <name type="person" key="245">Dr. Allen</name> presented to the Pathological Society of Philadelphia a brief &#34;<hi rend="italic">Synopsis of Autopsies made at <name type="hospital" key="176">Lincoln General Hospital</name></hi>,&#34; to which the reader is referred.&#8212;(Proceedings of the Pathological Society of Philadelphia, in the American Journal of the Medical Sciences, January, 1865, page 133.)  In this paper he analyzes the appearances observed in forty-one cases of diarrh&#339;a and dysentery, thirty-five of fever, twenty-one of pneumonia, and five of diphtheria. The notes of <name type="person" key="245">Dr. Allen</name>'s autopsies, from which the accounts here presented have been condensed, were not contained in the case-books of <name type="hospital" key="176">Lincoln hospital</name> turned in to the <name type="organization" key="xxx">Surgeon General's Office</name> at the close of the war, but have since been copied into them from the originals, loaned for the purpose.</p>
