                    which fractured the squamous portion of the left temporal bone.  He was conveyed
                    to <name type="place" key="#Washington">Washington</name>, and was admitted to the <name type="hospital" key="176">Lincoln
                        Hospital</name> on <date type="admit" when="1863-06-10">June 10th</date>,
                    where water dressings were applied.  Death occurred on <date type="death" when="1863-06-28">June 28th, 1863</date>.  Autopsy: The fracture, which had
                    radiating fissures, commenced one and a half inches anteriorly to the left ear
                    and extended one inch posteriorly, the opening being filled with disorganized
                    brain. Upon the removal of the <choice><orig>calvaria</orig><reg>calvarium</reg></choice>, the left hemisphere was observed to be
                    of a dark slate color, while the appearance of the right was natural. The dura
                    mater was lined with a dark unhealthy fluid. Pus also was found in the arachnoid
                    cavity on the left side. The pia mater was not affected. The inferior portion of
                    the middle cornu was disorganized, and had doubtless been involved in the
                    injury. Pus was found upon the superior surface of the cerebellum on both sides.  The pathological specimen is No. 1344, Sect. I, A. M. M., and shows the vault of
                    the cranium, with the line of section through the fractured bone, of which only
                    the upper part is apparent.   The specimen and history were contributed by <name type="person" key="76">Surgeon G. S. Palmer</name>, <name type="organization" key="132">U. S. V.</name></p>
