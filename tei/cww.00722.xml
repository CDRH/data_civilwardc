                <p>That your petitioner acquired <seg type="handwritten">his</seg> claim to the

                        the same may be found.</note>
                    <seg type="handwritten">by purchase from a man named <persName>Thomas

                        included <persName>Eliza's</persName> Mother and her four children and was
                        made to prevent their being sent out of the Country; within the past few
                        months the mother and three of the children have absconded.</seg></p>

                <p>That your petitioner's claim to the service or labor of said <seg

                        xml:id="n3">Here state such facts, if any there be, touching the value of

                        with an averment that the petitioner knows of no other infirmities or
                        defects of said person which impair the value of petitioner's claim to such
                        service or labor, and that he believes none other to exist. If the
                        petitioner specify no such infirmity or defect, then his statement touching
                        the value of his claim should conclude with an averment that he has no

                        active in every way promising</seg></p>

                <p>Your petitioner hereby declares that <seg type="handwritten">he</seg> bears true

                    the present rebellion, nor in any way given aid or comfort thereto.</p>

                <p>And your petitioner further states and alleges, that <seg type="handwritten"
                        >he</seg> has not brought said <seg type="handwritten"
                            ><persName>Eliza</persName></seg> into the District of Columbia since
                    the passage of said act of Congress; and that, at the time of the passage
                    thereof, said <seg type="handwritten"><persName>Eliza</persName></seg> was held
                    to service or labor therein under and by virtue of your petitioner's claim to
                    such service or labor.</p>

                <p>Your petitioner further states and alleges, that <seg type="handwritten"
                        >his</seg> said claim to the service or labor of said <seg
                        type="handwritten"><persName>Eliza Jordan</persName></seg> does not

                    in any manner aided or sustained the present rebellion against the Government of
                    the United States.</p>

                <p>And your petitioner prays the said Commissioners to investigate and determine the
                    validity of <seg type="handwritten">his</seg> said claim to the service or labor
                    of said <seg type="handwritten"><persName>Eliza Jordan</persName></seg> herein
                    above set forth; and if the same be found to be valid, that they appraise and
                    apportion the value of said claim in money, and report the same to the Secretary
                    of the Treasury of the United States, in conformity to the provisions of said
