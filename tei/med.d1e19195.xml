                                    <name type="organization">Co. G, 16th Maine Volunteers</name>, aged 18 years, was
                                      wounded at <name type="BATTLE" key="251">Fredericksburg, Virginia</name>, <date type="injury" when="1862-12-13">December 13th, 1862</date>, by a ball, which struck about the
                                                  junction of the external and middle thirds of the
                                                  right clavicle, passed downward, backward, and
                                                  inward, and emerged some inches below the spine of
                                                  the scapula. There was some comminution of the
                                                  external part of the clavicle, and the direction
                                                  of the ball made it certain that injury had been
                                                  inflicted in the scapula. He was treated in the
                                                  field, and, on <date type="admit" when="1862-12-18">the 18th</date>, sent to <name type="hospital" key="169">St. Aloysius Hospital</name>, Washington. When admitted, there were
                                                  symptoms of pneumonia, though otherwise there was
                                                  no evidence of injury to the lung. Soon afterward,
                                                  persistent diarrh&#339;a set in, which, with profuse
                                                  suppuration from the wound, gradually prostrated
                                                  him. Some detached pieces of bone were removed,
                                                  and the sharp ends of the clavicle taken off.
                                                  Supporting treatment. Death resulted on <date type="death" when="1863-01-13">January
                                                  13th, 1863</date>.  Necropsy: Aside from the injury of the
                                                  clavicle, the coracoid process was found entirely
                                                  detached, the spine of the scapula fractured along
                                                  the line of its junction with the body, the ball
                                                  having struck at the junction of the spine and
                                                  body, carrying away spicul&#230; from both. On opening
                                                  the joint an interesting complication was found,
                                                  not suspected during life. The cartilages were
                                                  eroded, and the head of the humerus presented a
                                                  carious appearance, and, at one point, looked as
                                                  if it had been injured by some detached fragment.
                                                  From this point, there was free communication with
                                                  the wound, admitting a flow of pus into the joint.
                                                  There was no opening in the cavity of the chest.
                                                  The right pleura-pulmonalis was covered with
                                                  lymph. Both lungs were congested posteriorly, and
                                                  a small superficial abscess was found in the
                                                  inferior lobe of the right. Liver considerably
                                                  enlarged but otherwise healthy. The pathological
                                                  specimen is No. 720, Section I, A. M. M., and was
