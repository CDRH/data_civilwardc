   <p>Case from the case-book of the <name type="hospital" key="501"><hi rend="initialcap">T</hi>HIRD <hi rend="initialcap">D</hi>IVISION</name> of the <name type="place" key="#Alexandria"><hi rend="initialcap">A</hi>LEXANDRIA</name> <hi rend="initialcap">H</hi>OSPITAL, <name type="person" key="134">Surgeon Edwin Bentley</name>, <name type="organization" key="132">U.

Typhoid fever.  When admitted, this man was suffering from diarrh&#339;a; his stomach was irritable; his urine scanty and high colored; his tongue red and dry.  Treatment: Alteratives, turpentine, supporting diet.  December 18th: There is more or less stupor, subsultus tendinum, involuntary stools.

The mucous membrane of the stomach was softened. The descending colon was thickened and softened, but no ulceration could be found. The liver was normal.</p> 
   <p>&#8432; It is to be regretted that, in most instances, the records of this hospital do not show by whom the autopsies were made. It is known that many of them were made by <name type="person" key="134">Surgeon Bentley</name> himself, or under his immediate supervision, but it is only possible to distinguish these from the others in a few cases.</p>
