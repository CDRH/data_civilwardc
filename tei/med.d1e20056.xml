          M&#8212;&#8212;</name>, <name type="organization" key="xxx">Co. E, 84th Pennsylvania
          Volunteers</name>, aged 29 years, was wounded at <name type="BATTLE" key="12">the
          Wilderness, Virginia</name>, <date type="injury" when="1864-05-06">May 6th, 1864</date>,
        by a conoidal ball, which entered at the superior angle of the scapula, passed backward,
        producing a compound comminuted fracture of the spine of the left scapula and remained in
        the wound. He was treated in the field until <date type="transfer" when="1864-05-14">the
          14th</date>, when he was transferred to <name type="hospital" key="167">Carver
          Hospital</name>, Washington. When admitted, his constitutional condition was excellent and
        the injured parts were in good condition; there was not much swelling but considerable pain.
        On <date type="operation" when="1864-05-17">May 17th</date>, <name type="person" key="xxx"
          >Acting Assistant Surgeon William E. Clark</name> administered chloroform and excised the
        fractured spine of the scapula through a straight incision immediately over it. He also
        removed the ball. The wound was then filled with charpie, and cold-water dressings applied.
        The patient reacted well from the shock of the operation and continued to improve, the wound
        granulating rapidly and secreting a quantity of laudable pus. On <date type="furlough"
          when="1864-06-17">June 17th, 1864</date>, he was furloughed, and, on <date type="admit"
          when="1864-09-10">September 10th</date>, admitted to <name type="hospital">Satterlee
          Hospital, Philadelphia</name>, whence he was transferred to the <name type="organization"
          key="109">Veteran Reserve Corps</name>, <date type="duty" when="1865-01-17">January 17th,
          1865</date>. Discharged from service on <date type="servicedischarge" when="1865-09-14"
          >September 14th, 1865</date>. The wood-cuts (<hi rend="initialcap">F</hi>IGS. 261 and 262)
        on the preceding page show the acromion and upper third of the spine of the left scapula,
        and the missile causing the fracture. It was contributed, with a history of the case, by
          <name type="person" key="102">Surgeon O. A. Judson</name>, <name type="organization"
          key="132">U. S. V.</name>

          type="pension" when="1866-05-11">May 11th, 1866</date>, that &#34;the ball entered and
        passed over and rather back of the head of the left humerus, shattering the scapula, and was
        extracted about one-third from the lower point of scapula. Arm can be raised nearly level
        carried forward pretty well, but not back. Scapula hollow, arm weak. Disability
        three-fourths, probably not wholly curable.&#34; </p>
