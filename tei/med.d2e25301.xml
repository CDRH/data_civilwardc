      when="1863-04-29">April 29, 1863</date>, with a "perforating wound of the left knee," and as

Keen, <choice><orig>jr.</orig><reg>Jr.</reg></choice></name>, reported the case as a "punctured wound of the knee joint" and described the injury as follows:  "The patient was admitted to <name
      type="hospital" key="xx">Satterlee Hospital</name> <date type="admit" when="1863-05-07">May 7th</date>. He stated that in <date type="injury" when="1862-12">the previous December</date> he
     met with a fall from his horse, during which a pair of scissors from his knapsack punctured the
     knee joint and broke off; that the points were removed <date type="operation" when="1862-12">three days after the accident</date>, being
     three inches deep according to the statement of his surgeon, and that severe inflammation
     followed and a large number of abscesses formed about the joint. At the time of the patient's
     admission the injured joint was smaller than the sound one, the hamstrings were contracted, and
     motion was limited from complete flexion to an angle of 135° with the thigh. Crepitation was
     very marked and motion of the patella much restricted. Just to the inside and above the
     tubercle of the tibia there was a cicatrix from a wound, and all about the joint old cicatrices
     from abscesses were found. The evidence was rather in favor of penetration of the joint, both
     by the position of the cicatrix mentioned and the escape of synovia, which seems probable from
     his statement, though of this he is not quite confident. The scissors were rusty when he was
     wounded. He walks about on crutches but is unable to bear weight on the limb." <name type="person" key="137">Surgeon I. I. Hayes</name>, <name type="organization" key="132">U. S. V.</name>, reported that the patient was discharged from <date type="servicedischarge" when="1863-06-01">June 1, 1863</date>, by reason of anchylosis of the left knee joint
     resulting from an injury by scissors penetrating the knee joint." The man is not a pensioner.</p>
