The spleen was light colored, and weighed but two ounces and a half. The liver appeared to be normal, and weighed fifty-five ounces and a half. The kidneys weighed four ounces each. The &#339;sophagus, stomach and small intestine were normal, with the exception of the lower portion of the ileum, where Peyer's patches presented the shaven-beard appearance, and the mucous membrane was much congested. In the large intestine the mucous membrane was entirely destroyed by ulceration, some of the ulcers penetrating to the peritoneum.&#8212;<name type="person" key="246">Acting Assistant Surgeon H. M.
