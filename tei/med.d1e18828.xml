He was admitted, at two o'clock, A. M., <date type="admit" when="1863-10-19">October 19th</date>, to <name type="hospital" key="162">Douglas Hospital</name>. When
                                                  admitted, the surface was cold and pale; pulse
                                                  small and feeble; countenance anxious; great
                                                  depression of the vital powers and pain at the
                                                  seat of injury. This state of collapse, together
                                                  with dyspn&#339;a, and a peculiar rattling of the
                                                  throat, as also a dullness of the abdomen, on
                                                  percussion, indicated that internal h&#230;morrhage
                                                  existed. The lungs were not implicated. The wound
                                                  was a small hole, circular in form, depressed, of
                                                  a livid color, and incapable of admitting the
                                                  little finger. It was situated on the right
                                                  hypochondrium, just below the cartilage of the
                                                  tenth rib, one-fourth of an inch externally to the
                                                  mammillary line. The wound was continually
                                                  discharging a small quantity of venous blood and
                                                  bloody serum. The patient was perfectly conscious.
                                                  He complained incessantly of great coldness and
                                                  pain near the wound. Upon removing his clothing it
                                                  was found that alvine discharges passed
                                                  involuntarily from him. Stimulants were given
                                                  freely, and water dressings applied to the wound,
                                                  with mustard poultices to the calves of the legs
                                                  to restore the circulation of blood to the
                                                  superficial skin. An anodyne was given. At nine
                                                  and a half o'clock A. M., he had somewhat revived. The paleness was not so well marked, and
                                                  his strength had rallied from the nervous shock.
                                                  Death resulted at a quarter past eleven o'clock P. M.,

                                                  the liver, and, after traversing it inward,
                                                  downward, and backward, emerged at the inferior
                                                  posterior aspect, external to the vena-cava,
                                                  penetrated the body of the eleventh dorsal
                                                  vertebra anteriorly on the right side, passed
                                                  obliquely upward and backward through the body of
                                                  the tenth, completely shattering it posteriorly
                                                  and breaking off the right pedicle, passed upward
                                                  and to the left, and emerged through the left
                                                  lamina of the ninth vertebra, resting against the
                                                  corresponding rib. There was a considerable
                                                  quantity of extravasated blood in the abdominal
                                                  cavity. The lungs were congested, but otherwise
                                                  healthy. The other organs were apparently intact.
