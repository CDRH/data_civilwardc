                <p>To the Commissioners under the act of Congress, approved the <date
                        when="1862-04-16">16th of April 1862</date>, entitled "An act for the
                    release of certain persons held to service or labor in the District of
                    Columbia."</p>

                <p>Your petitioner, <persName>Eglantine Randolph</persName> of the <placeName>city
                        of Washington</placeName>, <placeName>and District of Columbia</placeName>
                    respectfully showeth that at the time of the passage of the said act of
                    Congress, she held a claim to service or labor against
                        <persName>Louisa</persName> a person of African descent for and during the
                    life of said <persName>Louisa</persName> and that by said act of Congress said
                        <persName>Louisa</persName> was discharged and freed of and from all claim
                    of your petitioner to such service or labor; that at the time of said discharge
                    the said <persName>Louisa</persName> was of the following <choice>
                        <sic>discription</sic>
                        <corr>description</corr>

                    useful domestic and about 13 years of age.</p>


                <p>That your petitioner acquired her claim to the service or labor of the aforesaid
                        <persName>Louisa</persName> by settlement upon her on death of her sister,
                        <persName>Euphraim Beverly</persName> in <date when="1858">1858</date>, at
                        <placeName>Richmond</placeName>, soon after <persName>Louisa</persName> was
                    brought to this city &amp; duly registered in clerks office of current court</p>

                <p>That your petitioner's claim to the service or labor of the said
                        <persName>Louisa</persName>
                    <pb xml:id="leaf002r" facs="cww.00031.003.jpg"/> was, at the time of said
                    discharge therefrom, of the value of one thousand dollars.</p>

                <p>Your petitioner hereby declares that she is loyal to the government of the
                        <placeName>United States</placeName>, and that she has not borne arms
                    against the United States in the present rebellion, nor given aid or comfort to
                    the enemy.</p>

                <p>You petitioner further showeth that she has not brought the said
                        <persName>Louisa</persName> into the <placeName> District of
                        Columbia</placeName> since the passage of said act of Congress; and that, at
                    the time of the passage thereof, the said <persName>Louisa</persName> was held
                    to service or labor therein under and by virtue of your petitioner's claim to
                    such service or labor.</p>

                <p>Your petitioner further showeth that her said claim to the service or labor of
                    the said <persName>Louisa</persName> does not originate in or by virtue of any
                    transfer heretofore made by any person who has in any manner aided or sustained
                    the present rebellion against the United States.</p>

                <p>Your petitioner therefore prays the said Commissioners to investigate and
                    determine the validity of said claim to the service or labor of the said
                        <persName>Louisa</persName>; and if the same be found to be valid, that they
                    appraise and apportion the value of said claim in money, and report the same to
                    the Secretary of the Treasury of the <placeName>United States</placeName>, in
                    conformity to the provisions of said act of Congress.</p>
