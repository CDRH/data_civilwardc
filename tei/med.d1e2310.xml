                                        typhoid fever. On <date when="1861-10-06">the 6th</date> he was reported as weak and having
                                        suffused eyes, quick pulse, 115, hot and dry skin, moist,
                                        brown and slightly fissured tongue, anorexia, relaxed bowels
                                        and iliac tenderness. Turpentine emulsion and camphor with
                                        sweet spirit of nitre were ordered. Next day the patient was
                                        quite delirious and had three involuntary stools; sordes
                                        appeared on the teeth and six rose-colored spots on the
                                        skin. Milk-punch and tincture of opium were ordered. On the
                                        8th the rose-colored spots increased in number and the
                                        delirium was somewhat lessened; the five stools passed were
                                        not involuntary; some irritability of stomach was
                                        manifested. Sudamina appeared on the 10th with a fresh crop
                                        of rose-colored spots, and the tongue became red at the tip
                                        and edges. On the 11th epistaxis occurred and the patient
                                        was stupid. Next day headache accompanied the delirium, the
                                        other symptoms continuing as already stated. On the 14th the
                                        tongue was somewhat moist and the appetite improved. On the
                                        15th the pulse had fallen to 80, the diarrh&#339;a
                                        lessened, epistaxis recurred and the patient was more
                                        rational. Next day there was only one passage from the
                                        bowels, but the right iliac tenderness continued with some
                                        tympanites and gurgling. Rose-colored spots appeared on the
                                        18th and again on the 21st; on the former day the headache
                                        and delirium were greatly lessened, and on the 19th the
                                        tongue was clean and the appetite good; but some general
                                        tenderness continued in the abdomen and there was some
                                        cough. A free perspiration occurred during the following
                                        night, after which the progress of convalescence was steady.
