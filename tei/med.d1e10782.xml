Cav.</name>; age 21; was admitted <date type="admit" when="1862-08-16">Aug. 16, 1862</date>, with chronic diarrh&#339;a.  He improved under treatment, but on
                                <date type="injury" when="1862-09-04">September 4</date> his throat became sore and his tonsils, uvula
                                        and soft palate red and swollen, the pulse being natural but
                                        feeble. Chlorate of potassa with muriatic acid was given
                                        internally and as a gargle.  By the 6th a diphtheritic
                                        membrane covered the uvula, tonsils and epiglottis. Quinine,
                                        tincture of iron, beef-essence and stimulants were added to
                                        the treatment. At 8 P. M. the patient seemed moribund,&#8212;great dyspn&#339;a, with rapid, thready pulse and
                                        coldness of surface; but a few hours later he rallied and
                                        slept well during the night.  The urgent symptoms returned on
                                        the night of the 7th, and he died <date type="death" when="1864-09-08">next morning</date>.  About
                                        fifteen minutes before death he vomited a large quantity of
                                        greenish liquid containing whitish shreddy matter.  <hi rend="italic">Post-mortem</hi> examination: The larynx and trachea were
                                        highly inflamed, but as no false membrane was found it was
                                        assumed to have been dislodged by the emesis.&#8212;<hi rend="italic"><name type="person" key="454">Act. Ass't Surgeon Pierre R. Holly</name>, <name type="hospital" key="162">Douglas Hospital</name>, Washington,     D. C.</hi> </p>
