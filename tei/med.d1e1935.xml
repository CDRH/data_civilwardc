                                        back and limbs, and with loss of appetite. Throughout the
                                        progress of this case there was cough with much yellowish
                                        expectoration and some dyspnœa. Rose-colored spots
                                        appeared on the day of admission, and continued to erupt
                                        until the 30th. There was headache with dizziness, ringing
                                        in the ears and for a short time deafness; the tongue was
                                        moist, white in the centre and red at the tip and edges; the
                                        pulse was usually 80; the skin hot; the bowels relaxed, two
                                        to four stools daily being passed; the abdomen tympanitic

                                        regions. On the 31st, on the disappearance of the eruption,
                                        the skin was of the natural temperature, so recorded for the
                                        first time; the tongue coated, but the appetite good; one
                                        stool was passed; there was slight headache, and the cough
                                        persisted, with asthmatic paroxysms at night. He was
