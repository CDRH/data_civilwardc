                                                1863</date>, with remittent fever. He said he had
                                        been sick for six days, but had continued on duty although
                                        he suffered from a chill on <date when="1863-11-10">the 10th</date>. On <date when="1863-11-11">the 11th</date> he had a
                                        severe chill and was seen by the medical officer of the day,
                                        who ordered him into the ward. Two grains of quinine were
                                        given three times a day. On <date when="1863-11-12">the 12th</date> he had vomiting, and
                                        pain and tenderness in the left side of the chest. The
                                        quinine was omitted and three grains of calomel ordered
                                        every four hours until four powders had been taken, with a
                                        Seidlitz powder after the last dose. The bowels were moved
                                        on <date when="1863-11-13">the 13th</date>, but the vomiting continued until death on

                                        During his sickness the patient expressed no anxiety as to
                                        its result; he was confident that he would be able to return
                                        to duty in a few days.—<hi rend="italic"><name type="person" key="246">Act. Ass't Surg. Henry M.
