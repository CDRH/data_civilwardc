The heart weighed nine ounces and a quarter; there were fibrinous clots on both sides, which, together, weighed an ounce and a quarter; the pericardium contained some reddish-brown serum. The liver was firm, its acini distinct; it weighed fifty-three ounces and a half; the gall-bladder contained about three ounces of thin dark-green bile.
