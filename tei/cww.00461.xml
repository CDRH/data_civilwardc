            <div1 type="petition" subtype="handwritten">

                <p>To the Commissioners appointed under the act of Congress approved <date when="1862-04-16">April 16, 1862</date>, entitled "An act for the release of
                    certain persons held to service or labor in the <placeName>District of
                        Columbia</placeName>."</p>

                <p>Your Petition of <persName>Sarah E. King</persName>, of <placeName>Georgetown,
                        D.C.</placeName> respectfully <choice>
                        <sic>shews</sic>
                        <corr>shows</corr>
                    </choice> that she is a person loyal to the <placeName>United
                    States</placeName>, who, at the time of the passage of the said act of Congress,
                    held a claim to the service and labor of certain persons of African
                    descent, as her slaves for life, who, by said act, were discharged from said
                    claim; that said persons are of the names, ages &#38; description and values
                    following, viz; <persName>Mary Chase</persName>, mulatto, aged about sixty four
                    years, four feet nine inches in height, of the value of one hundred and fifty
                    dollars; <persName>Rachel <unclear reason="illegible" cert="high" resp="#jc">Coquire</unclear>
              </persName>, mulatto, aged about twenty eight years,
                    about five feet in height, of the value of six hundred dollars;
                        <persName>Selina <unclear reason="illegible" cert="high" resp="#jc">Coquire</unclear>
              </persName>, mulatto, twenty four years of age, about
                    five feet three inches in height, of the value of one thousand dollars;
                        <persName>Mary <unclear reason="illegible" cert="high" resp="#jc">Coquire</unclear>
              </persName>, mulatto aged seven years, about four feet
                    high, of the <pb xml:id="leaf001v" facs="cww.00461.002.jpg"/> value of three
                    hundred dollars; <persName>John <unclear reason="illegible" cert="high" resp="#jc">Coquire</unclear>
              </persName>, bright mulatto, aged five
                    years, about three feet high, of the value of three hundred dollars; and
                        <persName>Annette <unclear reason="illegible" cert="high" resp="#jc">Coquire</unclear>
              </persName>, bright mulatto, aged two years and five
                    months, about two feet high, of the value of one hundred and fifty dollars; that
                    your Petitioner acquired said claim by purchase from the administrators of her
                    father, to whom said slaves had always belonged, and said claim, when
                    discharged, was of the value of twenty five hundred dollars in money; that said
                        <persName>Rachel</persName> is probably worth more than the amount above
                    stated, as her value, but as she broke her arm when a child, your Petitioner
                    states her value somewhat below its true amount considering the work she is
                    capable of performing and the wages she has brought; and that with this
                    exception, she knows of no defect, mental, moral or physical, tending to impair
                    the value of said slaves.</p>

                <p>Your Petitioner hereby declares that she bears true and faithful allegiance to
                    the government of the <placeName>United States</placeName>
                    <pb xml:id="leaf002r" facs="cww.00461.003.jpg"/> and that she has not borne arms
                    against the <placeName>United States</placeName> during the present rebellion,
                    nor in any way given aid or comfort thereto; that she has not brought said
                    slaves into the <placeName>District of Cola</placeName> since the passage of
                    said act, but held them therein, at said dates, as her slaves for life, nor does
                    her claim to them originate in any transfer by anyone who has in any manner
                    aided or sustained the present rebellion</p>
