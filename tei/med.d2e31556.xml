Some viscus, thought to be the lower tip of the lung, protruded at the wound.  He died in two days (<date type="death" when="1862-06-17">June 17th</date>), with symptoms of peritonitis.  <hi rend="italic">Post mortem</hi>: The ball pierced the diaphragm without touching the lower lobe of the lung; there was no perforation of the intestines, but they were glued together by peritoneal inflammation. The pancreas protruded at the wound." </p>
