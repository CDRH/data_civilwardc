                    name was unknown</name>, was brought into the <name type="hospital" key="152">E
                    Street Infirmary</name>, Washington, D. C., with well marked symptoms of
                compression of the brain, in the latter part of <date type="admit" when="1864-02"
                    >February, 1864</date>. He was examined by <name type="person" key="287"
                    >Assistant Surgeon J. W. S. Gouley</name>, <name type="organization" key="190"
                    >U. S. A.</name>, who found a wound over the right parietal protuberance, caused
                apparently by a blow from the head of an axe. The scalp was shaved, and it was found
                that there was a depressed fracture of both tables of the skull, with detachment of
                a large fragment. It was not practicable to insert the elevator to raise the
                depressed fragment; to allow this to be done, a disk of bone was <date
                    type="operation" when="1864-02">removed by the trephine</date>. A triangular
                fragment, measuring an inch by one and a quarter inches, was then removed and the
                flaps of the scalp were approximated. The symptoms of compression were relieved, and
                the patient was doing well three days subsequently, when the specimen, represented
                in the adjacent wood-cut, (<hi rend="initialcap">F</hi>IG. 23), was forwarded to the
                    <name type="hospital" key="431">Army Medical Museum</name>. The facts above
                noted are taken from a minute, made upon the reception of the specimen, by <name
                    type="person" key="288">Surgeon John H. Brinton</name>, <name
                    type="organization" key="132">U. S. V.</name> It has been impracticable to learn
                the ultimate result of the case; but a letter from the late <name type="person"
                    key="289">Assistant Surgeon T. G. Mackenzie</name>, <name type="organization"
                    key="190">U. S. A.</name>, dated <date type="letter" when="1864-03-25">March
                    25th, 1864</date>, states that the man was doing well at that date, though his
                left arm was paralyzed. <name type="person" key="289">Dr. Mackenzie</name> refers to
                an escape of brain substance at the time of the injury; and <name type="person"
                    key="287">Dr. Gouley</name>, in forwarding this letter, states that at least
                half an ounce of brain matter was lost, and comments on the singular good fortune of
                the patient in recovering without the supervention of cerebral hernia, and without
                loss or apparent impairment of the mental faculties. </p>
