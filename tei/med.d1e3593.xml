                                        Next day his face was somewhat congested, eyes bright, pulse
                                        100, quick and strong, skin hot and moist, edges of the
                                        tongue dry and its centre covered with a brown crust,
                                        appetite small; three stools were passed, and there was some
                                        cough with viscid mucous expectoration. Turpentine emulsion
                                        and astringents were given. Rose-colored spots appeared on
                                        the 3d and continued to erupt at intervals until the 29th.
                                        The skin was generally moist; but on the 6th and 7th free
                                        perspiration occurred accompanied with sudamina; tinnitus
                                        aurium also was noted at this time, and the pulse fell to
                                        75. The bowels were moved once or twice daily, and there was
                                        more or less tenderness, chiefly umbilical and left iliac.
                                        Five stools were passed on the 10th and again on the 15th,
                                        but the tendency to diarrh&#339;a was not marked, for
                                        three grains of blue-pill repeated twice on the latter day,
                                        and six grains of compound cathartic pill repeated twice on
                                        each of the two following days, did not aggravate it; the
                                        bowels were generally moved twice, but sometimes only once
                                        daily to the end of the record. Profuse nocturnal
                                        perspiration occurred on the 15th and following days. The
                                        tongue on the 8th became red at the tip and edges and brown
                                        or yellowish-brown in the centre; on the 10th it became
                                        slightly dry in the middle; on the 17th red, moist, flabby
                                        and with prominent papill&#230;, and after this more or
                                        less coated to the end. The appetite continued good from the
                                        second day after admission, but on the 26th and 27th there
                                        was some irritability of stomach. Quinine was given at this
                                        period in three-grain doses every two hours. On the 29th the
                                        patient slept well; his eyes were bright; cheeks not
                                        flushed; pulse 78, regular; skin hot and moist, a few
                                        rose-spots appearing on the breast and abdomen; tongue red
                                        at the tip and edges, yellowish coated and fissured in the
                                        centre; appetite good; one stool was passed; the stomach
                                        continued irritable, and there was some cough with yellow
                                        expectoration. On the 31st he was sitting up; the gastric
                                        irritability and the cough had ceased. On <date
