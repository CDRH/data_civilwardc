      Miller</name>, <name type="organization" key="514">Co. K, 48th New York</name>, aged 38 years,
     was wounded in the right ankle, at <name type="BATTLE" key="16">Cold Harbor</name>, <date type="injury" when="1864-06-02">June 2, 1864</date>. He was admitted
     to the field hospital of the 3d division, Sixth Corps, and thence, <date type="transfer" when="1864-06-09">several days afterwards</date>, to the <name type="hospital" key="156">Seminary
      Hospital</name> at Georgetown. <name type="person" key="1366">Surgeon H. W. Ducachet</name>,
      <name type="organization" key="132">U. S. V.</name>, in charge of the latter hospital,
     reported that the patient obtained leave of absence on <date type="furlough" when="1864-06-13">June 13th</date> and proceeded to his home. On
     <date type="servicedischarge" when="1865-01-13">January 13, 1865</date>, the patient was discharged from service and pensioned.  <name type="person" key="1367">Dr. G. T. Stevens</name>, formerly Surgeon <name type="organization" key="415">77th
      New York Volunteers</name>, subsequently contributed the following description of the injury
     and resection of the ankle, which he performed:  "The wound was caused by a minié ball, which
     penetrated the ankle, entering just behind the outer malleolus, passing nearly through the
     bones, and lodging in the inner side of the tarsus. The os calcis and <choice><orig>astragalus</orig><reg>talus</reg></choice> were badly
     shattered. <date type="operation" when="1864-06-04">Two days after the reception of the injury</date> the patient was brought under the
     influence of chloroform with intent to amputate; but after carefully inspecting the wound it
     was decided to attempt to save the foot. The wound was then enlarged by crucial incision,
     splinters of bone were removed, and the ball, which laid in the inner side of the ankle, was
     extracted. The shattered fragments of the os calcis and <choice><orig>astragalus</orig><reg>talus</reg></choice> were then removed by a gouge
     and bone nippers, the wound was drawn together and water dressings were applied. On <date type="transfer" when="1864-06-06">June 6th</date>
     the patient was transferred to <name type="place" key="xx">White House Landing</name> in an
     army wagon, where he remained <date type="transfer" when="1864-06-09">three days</date>. Thence he was taken to <name type="place" key="#Washington">Washington</name>, and <date type="furlough" when="1864-06-13">a week
     afterwards</date> he went to his home in Brooklyn. Water dressings were continued. Extensive suppuration took place, and several deep incisions were made near the ankle. In about four weeks
     a considerable piece of dead bone came away, after which improvement was rapid. In injecting
     fluids into the original wound they passed freely through the ankle, coming out at an opening
     on the opposite side. In the course of eight weeks the patient was able to walk with crutches
     and from that time his recovery was rapid. He now (March 9, 1868) walks with little difficulty
     and there is no anchylosis."  The <name type="organization" key="xx">Brooklyn</name> and <name type="organization" key="xx">Boston Examining Board</name>s in <date type="pension" when="1874">1874</date>, <date type="pension" when="1875">1875</date>, and <date type="pension" when="1877">1877</date>,
     respectively, certified to "anchylosis of the ankle joint, tendons bound down," etc. The
     pensioner was paid <date type="pension" when="1880-06-04">June 4, 1880</date>.</p>
