                    C. B&#8212;&#8212;</name>, <name type="organization" key="777">Co. K, 5th
                    Maryland Volunteers</name>, aged 33 years, was wounded at the battle of <name
                    type="BATTLE" key="33">Antietam, Maryland</name>, <date type="injury"
                    when="1862-09-17">September 17th, 1862</date>. The missile entered the posterior
                part of the neck, one and one-half inches below the occipital protuberance just
                forward of the ligamentum nuch&#230;, passed upward and forward, and emerged above
                the right ramus of the lower jaw. He was sent to <name type="place" key="WASHINGTON"
                    >Washington</name>, and admitted to <name type="hospital" key="157">Columbian
                    College hospital</name> on <date type="admit" when="1862-09-20">September
                    20th</date>. No fracture could be discovered. He complained of difficulty in
                mastication, and there was evidently some injury of the facial nerve. In a few days
                the wound began to suppurate, and the patient walked about the ward apparently doing
                well. <date type="injury" when="1862-10-08">October 8th</date>, suppuration suddenly
                ceased. Chills occurred; the frequency of recurrence increased until October 12th,
                when there was heavy deep breathing, and many symptoms of meningitis. Drowsiness and
                stupor followed, and coma and death took place <date type="death" when="1862-10-14"
                    >October 14th, 1862</date>. At the autopsy it was found that the ball had
                detached the mastoid process, denuded the occipital and temporal bones of periosteum
                in the vicinity of the fracture. There was some redness and congestion of the blood
                vessels, but no traces of inflammation could be found in the brain itself. The
                specimen was sent to the <name type="hospital" key="431">Army Medical Museum</name>
                by <name type="person" key="1294">Surgeon A. Van Derveer</name>, <name

                represented in the adjacent wood-cut, (<hi rend="initialcap">F</hi>IG. 46.) The
                process is entirely detached at the base, the mastoid cells are opened, of course,
                but there is no fissuring or other lesion of the inner table and no attempt at
                repair. <name type="person" key="1294">Dr. Van Derveer's</name> report does not
                refer to any impairment of the sense of hearing prior to the supervention of
