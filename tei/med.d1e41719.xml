Smith</name>, <name type="organization" key="xxx">company G, 189th New York volunteers</name>; age 41; admitted from regimental hospital <date type="admit" when="1865-05-15">May 15, 1865</date>.  Chronic diarrhœa.  The patient was very low, and complained of pain in the region of the heart; on auscultation a blowing sound was heard.  ℞. Blue mass and opium of each eight grains, extract of nux vomica two grains; make eight pills. Take one every three hours.  This checked the diarrhœa somewhat, and the patient appeared to improve until <date type="injury" when="1865-05-23">May 23d</date>, when he had a severe attack of erysipelas, and died <date type="death" when="1865-05-24">May 24th</date>.  <hi rend="italic">Autopsy</hi> <date type="autopsy" when="1865-05-24">six hours after death</date>: The lower lobe of the right lung was hepatized. The pericardium contained four ounces of serum. The valves of the heart were thickened and closed imperfectly. The liver presented the nutmeg appearance; the gall-bladder was very much distended with bile.  [The state of the intestines is not recorded.]</p> 
   <p>⃰ It is to be regretted that, in most instances, the records of this hospital do not show by whom the autopsies were made. It is known that many of them were made by <name type="person" key="134">Surgeon Bentley</name> himself, or under his immediate supervision, but it is only possible to distinguish these from the others in a few cases.</p>
