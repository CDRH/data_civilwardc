                <p>To the Commissioners under the Act of Congress approved <date when="1862-04-16">April 16: 1862</date> entitled "An Act for the release of
                    certain persons held to service or labor in the <placeName>District of

                <p>Your Petitioner, <persName>Robert Dick</persName>, a citizen of the
                        <placeName>State of Maryland</placeName>, but at present residing in
                        <placeName>Georgetown</placeName> in the <placeName>District of
                        Columbia</placeName>, by this his petition in writing shows and states, that
                    he is a person loyal to the <placeName>United States</placeName>, who at the
                    time of the passage of the said Act of Congress held a claim to service or labor
                    against three persons of African descent of the names of <persName><hi rend="underline">Tom</hi></persName>—<persName><hi rend="underline">Mary</hi></persName>—and <persName><hi rend="underline">Barbara</hi></persName>, for and during the life of
                    said <persName><hi rend="underline">Tom</hi></persName>, said <persName><hi rend="underline">Mary</hi></persName> and said <persName><hi rend="underline">Barbara</hi></persName>; and that by said Act of
                    Congress said <persName><hi rend="underline">Tom</hi></persName> said
                            <persName><hi rend="underline">Mary</hi></persName> and said
                            <persName><hi rend="underline">Barbara</hi></persName> were discharged
                    and freed of and from all claim of your petitioner to such service or labor;
                    that at the time of said discharge said <persName><hi rend="underline">Tom</hi></persName> was of the age of thirty five years, of a dark color,
                    about five feet ten inches high, well formed and active—said <persName><hi rend="underline">Mary</hi></persName> was of or about the age of
                    seventeen years, of a dark color, five feet three or four inches high, and
                    rather stout and said <persName><hi rend="underline">Barbara</hi></persName> was

                    appearance;</p>

                <p>That your petitioner acquired his claim to the aforesaid service or labor of the
                    said <persName><hi rend="underline">Tom</hi></persName>, the said <persName><hi rend="underline">Mary</hi></persName>, and the said <persName><hi rend="underline">Barbara</hi></persName> by the same being born his
                    slaves for life, on his farms in <placeName>Montgomery County</placeName>
                    <pb xml:id="leaf001v" facs="cww.00947.002.jpg"/>
                    <placeName>State of Maryland</placeName>, of parents his slaves for life.</p>

                <p>That your petitioner's claim to the service or labor of said
                        <persName>Tom</persName>, said <persName>Mary</persName>, and said
                        <persName>Barbara</persName> was, at the time of said discharge therefrom,
                    of the value of fifteen hundred dollars, in money, for said <persName><hi rend="underline">Tom</hi></persName>; of the value of eight hundred
                    dollars, in money, for said <persName><hi rend="underline">Mary</hi></persName>;
                    and of the value of one thousand dollars, in money, for said <persName><hi rend="underline">Barbara</hi></persName></p>

                <p>Your petitioner avers that said <persName><hi rend="underline">Tom</hi></persName> said <persName><hi rend="underline">Mary</hi></persName> and said <persName><hi rend="underline">Barbara</hi></persName> are each and all young, healthy, strong and active
                    persons capable of performing, and who have performed, in their appropriate
                    spheres of household labor, the most efficient and valuable services as house
                    servants; and your petitioner avers, that he knows of no moral, mental or bodily
                    infirmities or defects, which can impair the value of your petitioner's claim to
                    such service or labor.</p>

                <p> Your petitioner hereby declares that he bears true and faithful allegiance to
                    the government of the <placeName>United States</placeName>, and that he has not
                    borne arms against the <placeName>United States</placeName> in the present
                    rebellion nor in any way given aid or comfort thereto.</p>

                <p>And your petitioner further states and avers that he has not brought said
                            <persName><hi rend="underline">Tom</hi></persName>, said <persName><hi rend="underline">Mary</hi></persName>, or said <persName><hi rend="underline">Barbara</hi></persName> into the <placeName>District of
                        Columbia</placeName> since the passage of said Act of Congress; and that at
                    the time of the passage thereof said <persName><hi rend="underline">Tom</hi></persName> said <persName><hi rend="underline">Mary</hi></persName> and said <persName><hi rend="underline">Barbara</hi></persName> were held to service or labor therein under and by
                        <pb xml:id="leaf002r" facs="cww.00947.003.jpg"/> virtue of your petitioners
                    claim to such service or labor.</p>

                <p>Your petitioner further states and avers, that his said claim to the service or
                    labor of said <persName>Tom</persName>, said <persName>Mary</persName> and said
                        <persName>Barbara</persName> does not originate in or by virtue of any
                    transfer heretofore made by any person who has in any manner aided or sustained
                    the present rebellion against the government of the <placeName>United
                        States</placeName>.</p>

                <p>And your petitioner prays the said Commissioners to investigate and determine the
                    validity of his said claim to the service or labor of said
                        <persName>Tom</persName>, said <persName>Mary</persName> and said
                        <persName>Barbara</persName> herein above set forth; and if the same be
                    found valid, that they appraise and apportion the value of said claim in
                    money, and report the same to the Secretary of the Treasury of the
                        <placeName>United States</placeName> in conformity to the provisions of
                    said Act of Congress.</p>
