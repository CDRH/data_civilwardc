          F&#8212;&#8212;</name>, <name type="organization">Co. F, 60th New York Volunteers</name>,
        aged 22 years, was wounded at the battle of <name type="BATTLE" key="251"
          >Fredericksburg</name>, <date type="injury" when="1863-05-03">May 3d, 1863</date>, by a
        conoidal ball, which fractured the superior and inferior maxilla. The ball entered the ala
        of the nostril, and passed downward and backward, splitting the ramus of the inferior
        maxilla, and emerged by two openings in front and below the pinna of the right ear. The
        superior maxilla of right side was destroyed, and the right portion of the inferior
        fractured and comminuted, and fissures running into the orbital process. He was, on <date
          type="admit" when="1863-05-07">May 7th</date>, admitted to <name type="hospital" key="167"
          >Carver Hospital</name>, Washington. Cold water dressings and bandages were applied.
        Slight h&#230;morrhage from the internal maxillary artery occurred at ten and eleven o'clock
        P. M., <date type="injury" when="1863-05-09">May 9th</date>, which yielded to compression;
        it again recurred profusely at twelve o'clock, amounting to about fifty fluid ounces of
        blood; attempts at compression of the carotid artery were unsuccessful, the patient being
        unmanageable from fear; during the remainder of the night and the day following, he was kept
        in a sitting posture, and ice retained in his mouth, and strictly forbidden to speak. At two
        o'clock P. M. on <date type="injury" when="1863-05-11">the 11th</date>, his pulse being on
        the increase, six drops of the tincture of aconite was ordered. The h&#230;morrhage returned
        in the evening, the patient became frantic with alarm, and prevented all attempts at
        compression. He died <date type="death" when="1863-05-11">immediately</date>. The autopsy
        revealed great comminution of the superior and inferior maxilla, and that the
        h&#230;morrhage proceeded from the trunk of the internal maxillary artery. The specimen is
        figured in the wood-cut. The case is reported by <name type="person">Acting Assistant
          Surgeon E. F. Bates</name>.</p>
