      Gardner</name>, <name type="organization" key="327">Co. A, 12th Illinois Cavalry</name>, aged
     29 years, was wounded at <name type="BATTLE" key="256">Mitchell's Ford, on the
      Rappahannock</name>, <date type="injury" when="1863-10-11">October 11, 1863</date>. <name type="person" key="xx">Surgeon S. B. Wylie Mitchell</name>, <name type="organization" key="365">8th Pennsylvania Cavalry</name>, reported that he was struck by a conoidal carbine
     ball, which entered four inches above the right knee, passed through the inner hamstring
     muscles and the adductor magnus, outward and downward, and lodged under the integument on the
     outer side of the thigh. Upon <date type="operation" when="1863-10-11">extracting the ball</date> through an incision there was a profuse
     hæmorrhage, which ceased spontaneously. The patient was sent by railway to <name type="place" key="#Washington">Washington</name>, and
     entered <name type="hospital" key="172">Emory Hospital</name> on <date type="admit" when="1863-10-13">October 13th</date>. <name type="person" key="877">Acting Assistant Surgeon
       J. Walsh</name> reported that "he was feeble and pallid; no pulsation could be detected in the
     tibial arteries of the injured limb. There was loss of sensibility and slight discoloration of
     the skin of the right foot. The leg was packed in raw cotton, and the temperature was kept up
     by bottles of hot water. Frictions with a stimulating liniment were occasionally employed.
     After October 18th, the leg was daily immersed in a bath of oxygen gas. On October 25th, two
     bits of blue cloth and a small piece of white cotton cloth were extracted from the wound. The
     foot was decidedly gangrenous, and gangrene began to advance rapidly up the leg." At this time
     a sketch of the appearances of the limb was made, under <name type="person" key="288">Surgeon
      J. H. Brinton</name>'s direction, by <name type="person" key="878">Hospital Steward E.
      Stauch</name>. This drawing was elaborated, after the lamented death of <name type="person" key="878">Mr. Stauch</name>, by <name type="person" key="879">Hospital Steward
       Schultze</name>, and has been reproduced by chromolithography in the plate opposite (<hi rend="initialcap">P</hi>LATE <hi rend="initialcap">I</hi>, 28). On <date type="operation" when="1863-10-29">October 29th</date>, <name type="person" key="880">Acting Assistant Surgeon W. H. Ensign</name> amputated the limb at the lower third of the thigh. On examination of the amputated member it was found that the artery had been completely divided by the ball near the point at which it passes through the opening in the great adductor. The
     divided extremities of the artery were occluded by dark grumous clots. After the operation the
     patient was attacked by diarrhœa, and, on <date type="death" when="1863-12-05">December 5, 1863</date>, the case terminated fatally. A wet preparation of the lower half of the right femur, with a portion of the soft tissues, including
     the popliteal artery and vein, was contributed to the <name type="hospital" key="431">Army
      Medical Museum</name> by <name type="person" key="877">Acting Assistant Surgeon J. Walsh</name> (<hi rend="italic">Cat. Surg. Sect.</hi>, 1866, p. 521), and is represented in
