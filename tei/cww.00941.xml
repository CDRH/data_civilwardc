                <p>To the Commissioners appointed under the act entitled "An for the release of
                    certain persons held to service or labor in the District of Columbia" passed
                        <date when="1862-04-16">16 April 1862</date>.</p>

                <p>The Petition of <persName>Jos. H. Bradley</persName> of the <placeName>City of
                        Washington</placeName> respectfully <choice>
                        <sic>sheweth</sic>

                    </choice></p>

                <p>That he is loyal to the United States: that at the time of the passage of said
                    act he was residing in the <placeName>City of Washington</placeName>, and there
                    held and owned as his slave for a term of years, a girl of African descent,
                    named <persName>Louisa Carter</persName>, thirteen years of age in this present
                    month of <date when="1862-07">July</date>. The said <persName>Louisa</persName>
                    is remarkably grown for her age, above the medium height of woman; erect, of
                    easy carriage; with strong personal attractions: a bright mulatto; with hair, by
                    much attention made almost straight. I purchased her for a term of years to
                    expire on the <date when="1874-09-01">first day of September 1874</date>, from
                    Miss <persName>Elizabeth Williams</persName>, &amp; I produce and file herewith
                    the original bill of sale from Miss <persName>Williams</persName> by which it
                    will be seen that any children <persName>Louisa</persName> might have during her
                    servitude were to serve me till they should be twenty five years respectively.
                    At the expiration of <persName>Louisa</persName>'s term, &amp; as her children
                    born during the term should reach twenty five years of age, She and they are
                    made free by the said bill of sale which was executed acknowledged and recorded,
                    in Liber JAS No 81 folios 2 &amp; 3 one of the Land records of this County</p>

                <p><persName>Louisa</persName>'s mother belonged to Miss
                        <persName>Williams</persName> and was married to the foreman at my farm
                        <persName>Daniel <pb xml:id="leaf001v" facs="cww.00941.002.jpg"/>
                        Carter</persName>, a slave for life belonging to me. She was my cook &amp;
                    this girl was born under my roof. She was bred in the family &amp; carefully
                    trained, taught to read, and beginning to write. She has been trained as a lady,
                    maid, chamber maid, and sempstress; has waited at the table often <unclear reason="illegible" cert="high" resp="#kp">either</unclear>
                    assisting or in the absence of her brother my dining room servant and is
                    altogether a very valuable servant, healthy and coming of a good stock on both
                    sides. She had no market value with me, for no money price could have induced me
                    to part with her, but I believe with the condition in regard to the children and
                    she having more than twelve years to serve she would have brought in the market
                    upwards of a thousand dollars.</p>

                <p>I have always, and do bear true allegiance to the Government of the
                        <placeName>United States</placeName>—&amp; have neither borne arms
                    against the <placeName>United States</placeName> in, nor in anyway given aid or
                    comfort to those engaged in the present rebellion</p>

                <p>I have already stated that I held the said girl to service and labor in this
                        <placeName>District</placeName> at the time of the passage of said act; and
                    have shown how I acquired my title to her. I know Miss
                        <persName>Williams</persName> is &amp; always has been loyal to the
                    government of the <placeName>United States</placeName>.</p>

                <p>And I subscribe my claim to the adjudication of the Commissioners under the said
                    act</p>
