                                        surface of the heart was roughened with recent
                                        pseudomembrane and the inner surface of the pericardial sac
                                        was injected and partially roughened, but there was no
                                        adhesion; the sac contained about half a gill of serum. The
                                        right lung was collapsed to about the size of two fists and
                                        was in a condition of complete pneumonic hepatization; the
                                        pleural cavity was lined with a thick and roughened pyogenic
                                        membrane and contained about a gallon and a half of pus. The
                                        left lung, with the exception of bronchial inflammation and
                                        slight congestion, was healthy. The liver was flattened
                                        above from the purulent accumulation in the thorax, and
                                        purplish-red and darkly-spotted from engorgement of the
                                        central vessels of the lobuli; the spleen was rather soft and Indian-red on section. The stomach and intestines
                                        were generally healthy excepting some moderately and recently inflamed patches and streaks in
                                        the ileum and colon; the intestinal glands were healthy. The
                                        kidneys, though seeming somewhat fatty to the naked eye,
                                        appeared normal on microscopical examination.&#8212;<hi rend="italic"><name type="person">Act. Ass't Surgeon J. Leidy</name>, <name type="hospital">Satterlee Hospital, Philadelphia</name>, Pa.</hi> </p>
