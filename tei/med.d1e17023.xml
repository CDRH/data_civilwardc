                                                  was applied, and a button of bone, consisting of

                                                  driven backward between the tables beyond the

                                                  would permit of the gradual and spontaneous
                                                  elevation of the inner table, and it being

                                                  determined to leave the case without further
                                                  interference, unless symptoms of convulsions
                                                  recurred. Ice was applied, and no untoward
                                                  symptoms occurred. The inner table partially
