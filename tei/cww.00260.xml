                    is a sprightly, smart child and was very useful in the house of your
                    Petitioner</p>

                <p>Your Petitioner cannot state what was the value at said time of his said claim to

                            ><persName>Fanny</persName></hi>, but he believes that the value of his

                    children <persName>Annie</persName> and <persName>Fanny</persName> was at the

                <p>Your Petitioners claim to the service or labor of said <hi rend="underline"
                            ><persName>Hezekiah Smith</persName></hi> was at the time of said
                    discharge of the value of Fourteen hundred dollars In the beginning of the year
                        <date when="1858">1858</date> your Petitioner paid $690.00 for him He is
                    strong and well built. For the last four years he has been hired out as a <choice>

                    week.</p>

                <p>Your Petitioner's claim to the service or labor of said <hi rend="underline"
                            ><persName>Louisa M. Whitaker</persName></hi> was at the time of said
                    discharge of the value of Twelve hundred in money. Your Petitioner bought her in
                        <date when="1848">1848</date> when she was about three years old for the sum
                    of $80. She was nurse and chambermaid in your Petitioner's family and is healthy
                    and well grown to have a person in the place of said <persName>Louisa</persName>
                    would cost your Petitioner from $6 to $8 per month</p>
                <p>All of said five persons have always lived in the family of your Petitioner or in
                    that of his father and are all of them healthy. <persName>Margaret</persName>
                    <persName>Annie</persName>, <persName>Hezekiah</persName> and
                        <persName>Louisa</persName> are industrious and honest and very capable and
                    competent servants and your Petitioner knows of no mental moral or bodily
                    defects or infirmities in any of said five persons as would impair the value of
                    your Petitioner's claim to the service or labor of said <pb xml:id="leaf004v"
                        facs="cww.00260.005.jpg"/> five persons or of any of them and he believes
                    that none such exist. Your Petitioner further declares that while he has placed
                    what he believes to be a fair valuation on said five persons, they were of much
                    greater value to him and had he been disposed to sell them within the last two
                    years he is confident that he could have gotten a price for
                        <persName>Margaret</persName>, <persName>Hezekiah</persName> and
                        <persName>Louisa</persName> much in excess of the value which he has herein
                    before placed on them.</p>
