                                                  which struck just below the calf, on the inner
                                                  side of the left leg, and split upon the bone, one

                                                  the leg. This wound bled freely and occasioned
                                                  considerable pain, but he kept his place, till, as
                                                  he thinks, about a half hour later, when he was
                                                  struck again by a round bullet on the left side;
                                                  the missile passed directly through the cavity of
                                                  the chest, grazing the lungs and liver, and

                                                  right side. It then entered the right arm and
                                                  fractured the humerus into the elbow joint, where
                                                  it lodged; the spiral nerve was injured. The first

                                                  left the field and walked a distance of about two
                                                  miles, when, exhausted by loss of blood, he
                                                  fainted. He was conveyed to <name type="place">Alexandria</name>, and

                                                  which had lodged in the leg; it was found
                                                  flattened and ragged-edged. The case progressed
                                                  favorably for about eight weeks, when the wound of
                                                  the chest closed. This was followed by diarrh&#339;a
                                                  and feverishness, which symptoms passed off in a
                                                  few days. His appetite and flesh returned, and he
                                                  was discharged from service on <date type="servicedischarge" when="1863-01-14">January 14th, 1863</date>.

                                                  followed by severe pain in left side, disturbed
                                                  sleep, impaired appetite, laborious breathing,
                                                  swollen limbs, night sweats, and profuse expectoration. These symptoms becoming more and more
                                                  aggravated, and evidence of pus in pleural cavity
                                                  being well defined, the operation of
                                                  thoracocentesis was performed by <name type="person" key="xxx">Dr. Smith Ely</name>, of <name type="place">Newburgh, New York</name>, on <date type="operation" when="1863-04-28">April 28th</date>. A <choice><orig>trocar</orig><reg>trochar</reg></choice> was
                                                  plunged into the cavity of the chest, just below
                                                  the left shoulder blade, and an India-rubber tube
                                                  inserted in the opening, the ends of which were
                                                  left hanging down about four inches, the one
                                                  within and the other on the outside of the chest.
                                                  The operation was painful in the extreme, but,
                                                  weak and emaciated as he was, he endured it
                                                  without flinching. No anesthetic could be
                                                  administered, owing to his feeble condition.
                                                  Through the syphon formed by the tube, there was
                                                  discharged, during the ensuing ten days, about
                                                  seven quarts of matter. At the end of that time,
                                                  the tube was removed and the opening immediately
                                                  closed. The heart, which had been pushed around to
                                                  the right side, resumed its natural position, and
                                                  the lungs their proper functions. The cough
                                                  ceased, swelling disappeared from his limbs, and
                                                  his health gradually improved, until about
