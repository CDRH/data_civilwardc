                                        epistaxis.  Diagnosis—typhoid fever.  On admission
                                        the pulse was 114, the skin hot and moist, the face flushed,
                                        the tongue gray in the centre and red at the tip and edges;
                                        there was diarrhœa, with irritability of the
                                        stomach and much tenderness in the right iliac region; the
                                        patient was sometimes affected with dizziness, but his mind
                                        was clear. Blue-pill was given.  On <date when="1861-09-21">the 21st</date> he had five
                                        stools with persisting tenderness and gurgling, anorexia, a
                                        slight cough, epistaxis and deafness; his face was flushed,
                                        skin hot and moist, tongue red at tip, whitish-gray at base.  On <date when="1861-09-22">the 22d</date> the epistaxis recurred; the tongue was dark-red
                                        at the tip, brown at the base, and its papillæ were
                                        prominent; the skin was warm and dry and presented one or
                                        two rose-colored spots; one stool was passed and the
                                        tenderness continued; pulse 76. Quinine in eight-grain doses
                                        was given three times daily, with morphia at night.  The
                                        eruption faded next day, but appeared again on the 24th. The
                                        tongue began to clean on the 22d and the skin softened on
                                        the same day, after which, although the bowels continued
                                        relaxed and tender for a few days and the throat became
                                        slightly sore on the 27th, there was a steady improvement,
                                        and the patient was returned to duty <date type="duty" when="1861-10-09">October 9</date>. </p>
