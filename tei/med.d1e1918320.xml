          <name type="organization">Co. G, 69th New York Volunteers</name>, was wounded at <name
          type="battle">Malvern Hill</name>, <date type="injury" when="1862-07-01">July 1st,
          1862</date>, a bullet striking his chest, about two inches to the left of the median line,
        at the fourth rib, and lodging in the lower portion of the body of the sternum. Various
        efforts were made to remove it by counter openings, but in vain, and, <date
          type="servicedischarge" when="1863-04">after nine months</date> in general hospitals in
          <name type="place" key="#Washington">Washington</name> and <name type="place">New
          York</name>, he was discharged, as unfit for service. The wound had healed to a certain
        extent, and he went to work at his trade of shipwright. He re&#235;nlisted in <date
          type="enlist" when="1864-02">February, 1864</date>, the wound, at the time of examination,
        presenting the ordinary appearances of old gunshot wounds. He was immediately sent to <name
          type="place">Riker's Island, New York Harbor</name>, where he underwent a great deal of
        unnecessary exposure to the elements, and also to other deleterious influences for which
        that depot was, at one time, notorious. The wound broke out afresh, the surrounding parts
        became swollen, red, and painful, and an attack of broncho-pneumonia was superadded. An
        examination, by N&#233;laton's probe, indicated the nature and position of the bullet, the
        existence of which had been previously doubted or denied. It was removed, without
        difficulty, by simple incision. No spicul&#230; of carious bone were found loose, though the
        sternum exhibited a depression corresponding, in some measure, to the size of the bullet.
        About an ounce of f&#339;tid pus was discharged from the surrounding tissues. The missile
        was contributed to the <name type="hospital" key="431">Army Medical Museum</name>, with the
        foregoing account, by <name type="person">Surgeon William O'Meagher</name>, <name
          type="organization">69th New York Volunteers</name>. It is shown in the adjoining
        wood-cut. Not a pensioner.</p>
