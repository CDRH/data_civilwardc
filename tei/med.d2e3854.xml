C, 6th New Hampshire</name>, aged 30 years, was wounded in the right leg, at <name type="BATTLE" key="127">Bull Run</name>, <date type="injury" when="1862-08-29">August 29, 1862</date>. He was admitted to the <name type="hospital" key="170">Georgetown College Hospital</name>, subsequently transferred to <name type="hospital" key="xxx">Satterlee, Philadelphia</name>, and lastly to Lovell, <name type="place">Portsmouth Grove</name>. <name type="person" key="xxx">Assistant Surgeon W. F. Cormick</name>, <name type="organization" key="190">U. S. A.</name>, in charge of the latter, reported:
    &#34;Wound healed with severe contraction of the tendo-achilles, resulting from extensive and repeated sloughing. On <date type="operation" when="1863-10-05">October 5, 1863</date>, tenotomy was performed, by dividing the tendo-achilles, by <name type="person" key="xxx">Acting Assistant Surgeon J. W. Cushing</name>. The wound
    caused by the operation healed by November 23th, and the splints, etc., were removed, the foot and ankle resuming their former
    positions and functions. On December 15th the patient was able to walk without crutch or cane. He was discharged from
    service <date type="servicedischarge" when="1863-12-30">December 30, 1863</date>.&#34; <name type="person" key="xxx">Examiner W. G. Perry</name>, of <name type="place">Exeter, N. H.</name>, <date type="pension" when="1864-02-17">February 17, 1864</date>, certified:  &#34;Ball entered the outside about midway between the knee and ankle joints, passing directly across the leg.   &#42;   &#42;   There is contraction of the tendo-achilles,
    which has been partially relieved by division, but he cannot bring his heel entirely down. Standing causes pain.&#34; In
    <date type="pension" when="1869-10">October, 1869</date>, he reported that contraction in the use of the leg had produced irritation of the eschar, resulting in ulceration.
    <name type="person" key="xxx">Examiner E. B. Hammond</name> stated, <date type="pension" when="1875-09-11">September 11, 1875</date>:  &#34;The foot is reduced in size, the leg is weak, etc. &#34; The pensioner
    was paid <date type="pension" when="1876-06-04">June 4, 1876</date>.  </p>
