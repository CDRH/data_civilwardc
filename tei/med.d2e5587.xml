      soldier</name> of <name type="organization" key="394">General Pope's Army of Virginia</name>,
     was admitted on <date type="admit" when="1862-09-02">September 2, 1862</date>, to the <name type="hospital" key="163">Cliffburne Hospital</name> at Washington, D. C., with a gunshot
     fracture of the neck of the left femur, received at the <name type="BATTLE" key="127">second Bull Run</name> battle, on <date type="injury" when="1862-08-29">August 29, 1862</date>. A
     conoidal musket ball had entered the left hip directly over the trochanter major and embedded
     itself in the neck of the femur. The trochanter major and the neck of the femur were split and
     comminuted, but the head was uninjured. The patient had suffered greatly from the journey from
     the battle-field to the hospital, and was prostrated by diarrhœa and malarial complications. The
     tissues about the hip joint were but slightly swollen, and the wound discharged healthy pus. It
     was decided that excision was the most hopeful resource, and on <date type="operation" when="1862-09-04">September 4, 1862</date>, <name type="person" key="294">Assistant Surgeon John S. Billings</name>, <name type="organization" key="190">U. S. A.</name>, proceeded to operate. Chloroform was administered, and a straight
     incision was made over the trochanter major, and the head and fragments of the neck were
     removed. The shaft of the femur was then divided by a chain saw at the level of the trochanter
     minor. The patient reacted well from the operation. He was placed on a fracture bed, and
     extension by means of a weight was made on the injured limb. The diarrhœa increased in
     severity despite all treatment, and the patient succumbed, exhausted, on <date type="death" when="1862-09-24">September 24, 1862</date>, twenty days after the operation.</p>
