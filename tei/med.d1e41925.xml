   <p>The chromo plate facing page 518 represents a thickened an&#230;mic-looking portion of colon,
    on the surface of which there are a great number of small follicular ulcers. The following is a
    memorandum of the case from which the specimen was taken:</p>
   <p><hi rend="initialcap">C</hi>ASE 901.&#8212;<name type="person" key="xxx">Private Jacob
     Leonard</name>, <name type="organization" key="xxx">27th New York battery</name>, while doing
    duty with his regiment in the <name type="organization" key="377">army of the Potomac</name>,
    was attacked with chronic diarrh&#339;a, which was treated with variable success for several
    months. He finally broke down, and was admitted, <date type="admit" when="1864-08-28">August 28,
     1864</date>, to the field hospital of the first division, 9th army corps, where the diagnosis
    recorded was "dropsy," which had by this time become a prominent feature of the case, for, when
    the patient was transferred, <date type="transfer" when="1864-08-31">August 31st</date>, to the
    depot hospital of the 9th corps, <name type="place">City Point, Virginia</name>, the diagnosis
    there entered on the register was "ascites and anasarca." <date type="transfer"
     when="1864-09-08">September 8th</date>, <name type="person" key="xxx">Leonard</name> was sent
    north, and <date type="admit" when="1864-09-09">next day</date> was admitted to <name
     type="hospital" key="162">Douglas hospital</name>, Washington, D. C., where the diagnosis
    recorded was "scorbutic diarrh&#339;a." He died <date type="death" when="1864-09-16">September
     16th</date>. No further details of the case, or of the appearances observed during the autopsy,
    have been recorded.</p>
   <p>The plate is a reproduction of a water-color drawing made at the <name type="hospital"
     key="xxx">Museum</name> by <name type="person" key="xxx">Mr. H. Faber</name> immediately after
    the autopsy. The mucous surface of the colon is of a pale cream color, with pale-bluish and
    reddish patches. The ulcers are numerous, and vary in size from mere points to the tenth of an
    inch in diameter. Nearly the whole of the colon was brought to <name type="hospital" key="431"
     >the Museum</name>, and the piece fairly represents the condition of all parts of it.</p>
