      Wheeler</name>, <name type="organization" key="477">Co. E, 97th New York</name>, was wounded

      type="organization" key="431">83d New York</name>, recorded his admission to the field hospital of the 2d division, First Corps, with "shot
     wound of knee; patella removed." On <date type="admit" when="1862-12-25">December 25th</date>,
     the wounded man was admitted to the <name type="hospital" key="159">Patent Office
      Hospital</name>, Washington, whence <name type="person" key="1209">Assistant Surgeon G. W.
      Hoover</name>, <name type="organization" key="469">132d Pennsylvania</name>, reported that the
     patient died from the effects of a "wound of the left knee joint," <date type="death"
      when="1863-02-01">February 1, 1863</date>.&#179; </p>
   <p>&#179; In response to the editor's letter of inquiry. <name type="person" key="xx">Dr. R. S. Dana</name>, of <name type="place">Morrisville, Pennsylvania</name>, formerly Surgeon <name type="organization" key="xxx">107th Pennsylvania</name>, wrote under
    date March 23, 1868:   &#34;<name type="person" key="1208">Private Jerome Wheeler</name> I cannot be so positive about, but think that he was operated on by <name type="person" key="xx">Drs. Nordquist</name> and <name type="person" key="xx">Coxe</name>, Surgeons
    of <name type="organization" key="xxx">New York regiments</name>, and that in his case the joint was penetrated by a ball, and the operation consisted in the removal of the upper portion of the
    head of the tibia and the opposing surface of the condyles of the femur, calculating that bony union and a fixed knee would result, shortening the limb
    from 1 to 1&#189; inches. The result of the operation we know nothing about, as the hospital was cleared as rapidly as possible.&#34;</p>
