Chronic diarrhœa of long standing.  He was extremely feeble and much emaciated; had on an average ten stools daily, accompanied by pain in the bowels. The abdomen was tender on pressure; pulse frequent and feeble; tongue red and smooth.  Stimulants and astringents were administered, and warm fomentations applied.  Died, <date type="death" when="1863-01-12">January 12, 1863</date>.  <hi rend="italic">Autopsy:</hi> The lower lobes of both lungs were slightly congested. The heart was normal. The mucous membrane of the stomach was extremely pale; that of the ileum, especially in its lower part, was softened, and coated with a <choice><orig>puruloid exudation</orig><reg>purulent exudate</reg></choice> . The colon was moderately congested. The mesenteric glands were much enlarged. The spleen enlarged. The liver enlarged and softened.</p> 
   <p>⃰ It is to be regretted that, in most instances, the records of this hospital do not show by whom the autopsies were made. It is known that many of them were made by <name type="person" key="134">Surgeon Bentley</name> himself, or under his immediate supervision, but it is only possible to distinguish these from the others in a few cases.</p>
