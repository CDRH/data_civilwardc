      Bearden</name>, <name type="organization" key="526">Co. D, 6th Tennessee</name>, aged 34
     years, was wounded in the left foot, at the <name type="BATTLE" key="69">Chattahoochee River</name>, <date type="injury" when="1864-07-01">July 1, 1864</date>, and was
     admitted to Lookout Mountain Hospital near <name type="place">Chattanooga</name> <date type="admit" when="1864-07-09">eight days afterwards</date>. <name type="person" key="xx">Surgeon L. D. Harlow</name>, <name
      type="organization" key="132">U. S. V.</name>, reported:  "A conical ball fractured the cuboid
     bone and lodged in the centre of the foot under the scaphoid bone. The foot became greatly
     swollen and inflamed, particularly on the inner side, and the patient, who had been a strong
     and robust man previous to the injury, grew weak, feverish, and irritable. On <date type="operation" when="1864-08-27">August 27th</date> an
     abscess which had formed on the internal surface was opened, and the ball was extracted through
     the opening. Chloroform was used during the operation. Rapid improvement followed."  The patient
     subsequently entered the Officer's Hospital at <name type="place">Knoxville</name>, where he was mustered out of service <date type="servicedischarge" when="1865-04-27">April 27,
      1865</date>, and pensioned. The <name type="organization" key="xx">Knoxville Examining
      Board</name> certified to anchylosis resulting from the injury. The <name type="organization"
       key="785">Pension Office Examining Board</name>, <name type="place" key="#Washington">Washington, D. C.</name>, reported the pensioner's
     condition <date type="pension" when="1881-03-11">March 11, 1881</date>, as follows:  "This man can do no manual labor. The ankle and leg to
     the knee are much enlarged, and the lower two-thirds of the tibia and soft parts are much
     diseased. He has to use crutches at times to walk, and a stout cane at all times. He is very
     lame, and from the great ulceration of the bone and soft parts must suffer constant pain." </p>
