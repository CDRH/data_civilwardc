        <hi rend="initialcap">C</hi>ASE 16.—<name type="person" key="xxx">Private John M.
          Mosher</name>, <name type="organization" key="xxx">Co. I, 1st Maine Cavalry</name>, was
        wounded at <name type="BATTLE" key="xxx">Brandy Station, Virginia</name>, <date type="injury" when="1863-10-12">October 12th, 1863</date>, by an elongated rifle ball,
        which struck near the costal cartilage of the fifth rib, coursed inward and to the right,
        and, passing over the xiphoid appendage, perforated the diaphragm, entered the liver
        immediately to the right of the suspensory ligament, passed outward and slightly upward and
        emerged on the posterior surface of the greater lobe to rest beneath the diaphragm. He was
        taken to the field hospital, where he remained for several days, when he was sent to <name type="place" key="#Washington">Washington</name> and admitted to <name type="hospital" key="176">Lincoln Hospital</name> on <date type="admit" when="1863-10-19">the 19th</date>.
        Death resulted on <date type="death" when="1863-10-20">October 20th, 1863</date>, from
        pericarditis and pleurisy. The necropsy revealed the course of the ball. The right lung was
        not visible, its site being occupied by a puffy mass of emphysematous cellular tissue in a
        state of inflammation; toward the median line this infiltration was covered by a thick layer
        of exudation of a dark purplish red color. The pericardium was covered externally with a
        layer of lymph of a recent formation. There was about one-half pint of dark and serous fluid
        in each pleural cavity. On section of the first and second lobes they were found congested,
        especially at the apex of the first. Bronchial irritation was shown by the excess of the
        frothy secretion in this part. Immediately to the right of the suspensory ligament a ragged
        roundish opening was seen; five and a half inches to the right, and, on a line with this,
        another opening was observed of the same general appearance as the first. At this point, the
        liver was firmly adherent to the diaphragm by inflammatory products, as, indeed, was the
        greater part of the right lobe, but the latter were much older adhesions than those around
        the wound. At this opening, a brass button was found with a portion of clothing attached.
        The missile, disfigured a very little, with an ordinary military coat button inverted,
        together with the cloth to which it was sewn, is represented by the wood-cut (<hi rend="initialcap">F</hi>IG. 286). It was contributed, with notes of the case, by <name type="person" key="245">Assistant Surgeon H. Allen</name>, <name type="organization" key="190">U. S. A.</name>, from <name type="hospital" key="176">Lincoln Hospital</name>. </p>
