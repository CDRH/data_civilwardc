      <p><hi rend="initialcap">C</hi>ASE.&#8212;<name type="person">Private Joseph Wolf</name>,
          <name type="organization">Co. F, 7th New York Heavy Artillery</name>, aged 22 years, was
        wounded on <date type="injury" when="1865-04-03">April 3d, 1865</date>, before <name
          type="BATTLE" key="254">Petersburg, Virginia</name>, by a conoidal ball, which entered the
        scalp near the posterior superior angle of the right parietal bone, and glanced upward,
        denuding the bone of periosteum for a space one inch in circumference. He was on <date
          type="admit" when="1865-04-03">the same day</date> admitted to the <name type="hospital"
          >hospital of the 1st division, Second Corps</name>, and thence conveyed to Washington,
        where he entered the <name type="hospital">Armory Square Hospital</name> on <date
          type="transfer" when="1865-04-12">the 12th</date>, with complete paralysis of the left arm
        and leg. He was slightly comatose, but could easily be aroused, and answered questions
        intelligently; the pupils were contracted. An examination revealed a fissure extending
        beyond the denuded portion, through which pus slowly exuded, but no depression was observed.
        Ether was administered on <date type="operation" when="1865-04-14">the 14th</date>, and
          <name type="person">Surgeon D. W. Bliss</name>, <name type="organization" key="132">U. S.
          V.</name>, applied the trephine. Upon removing the button of bone, a similar fissure
        through the internal table was discovered. The dura mater protruded through the opening, and
        upon puncturing the membrane, about three ounces of sero-sanguineous fluid escaped. The
        operation afforded no immediate relief to the patient, but at the end of six hours he could
        move his hand and foot, and on the following day could raise his head. On the 20th, the
        wound was granulating finely, and the patient doing well. He could move his leg and arm
        freely on the 26th. and was able to stand upon his feet. On May 1st the paralysis had almost
        disappeared, and the wound was entirely covered with granulations. <date type="operation"
          when="1865-05-03">Two days later</date> a small circle of necrosed bone was removed from
        the external table. The patient was now able to walk about the ward, and on the <date
          type="transfer" when="1865-05-26">26th</date>, was transferred to the <name
          type="hospital">Whitehall Hospital</name>, near <name type="place">Bristol,
          Pennsylvania</name>, whence he was discharged from the service on <date
          type="servicedischarge" when="1865-06-20">June 20th, 1865</date>. His claim for pension
        was "pending" <date type="pension" when="1871-12-07">December 7th, 1871</date>. The specimen
        is a disk of bone with a serrated fragment of the inner table of the right parietal bone,
        and is represented in the wood-cut. The disk is one inch in diameter, and is traversed by
        the line of fracture. The specimen was contributed by the operator, <name type="person"
          >Surgeon D. W. Bliss</name>, <name type="organization" key="132">U. S. V.</name></p>
