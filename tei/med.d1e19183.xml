          <name type="organization">Co. I, 28th New Jersey Volunteers</name>, aged 24 years, was
        wounded at <name type="BATTLE" key="251">Fredericksburg</name>, <date type="injury"
          when="1862-12-12">December 12th, 1862</date>, by a ball, which, entering the back on the
        right side, within a half inch of the vertebral column, opposite the spinous process of the
        sixth dorsal vertebra, and apparently passing upward beneath the scapula and over the
        shoulder, fractured the right clavicle just within the coraco-clavicular ligament, making a
        complete transverse fracture, and lodging in the soft tissues below and in a vertical line
        with the point of fracture, where it was readily recognized. He was treated in the field
        hospital of the 2d division, Second Corps, and on <date type="transfer" when="1862-12-18"
          >the 18th</date> was transferred to the <name type="hospital">Presbyterian Church
          Hospital, Georgetown</name>; on <date type="transfer" when="1862-12-30">December 30th,
          1862</date>, to <name type="hospital">Harewood Hospital</name>, Washington, and, on <date
          type="transfer" when="1863-01-31">January 31st, 1863</date>, to <name type="hospital"
          >Broad and Cherry Streets Hospital, Philadelphia</name>. When admitted, the wound of
        entrance had entirely healed, and firm union had taken place at the seat of fracture, the
        inner fragment overlapping. The patient stated that, a few days after the reception of the
        injury, he spat a small amount of clotted blood, and continued to do so at intervals for two
        days, after which it entirely ceased. He also had some difficulty of respiration for a short
        period but was not treated for any disease of the lung. On <date type="operation"
          when="1863-02-22">February 22d, 1863</date>, the ball was cut out by <name type="person"
          >Surgeon John Neill</name>, <name type="organization" key="132">U. S. V.</name>
        <name type="person">Berry</name> recovered without any serious symptoms at any time, and was
        discharged from service on <date type="servicedischarge" when="1863-03-12">March 12th,
          1863</date>. The missile, represented in the adjacent wood-cut (<hi rend="initialcap"
          >F</hi>IG. 210), was a musket ball, notched at the apex and grooved on the side. It was
        contributed, with the history, by the operator. Not a pensioner. </p>
