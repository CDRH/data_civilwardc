Upon examination, it was thought the pulmonary organs had escaped injury. There was at no time hæmoptysis. The general condition was favorable until August 28th, when there was a chill, followed by severe coughing, the expectoration being purulent and mixed with bilious matter. This form of expectoration continued until the patient's death, <date type="death" when="1862-09-08">September 8, 1862</date>.  At the autopsy, it was found that the ball had passed through the lower lobe of the right lung, the diaphragm, and had grooved the convex surface of the liver.</p>
