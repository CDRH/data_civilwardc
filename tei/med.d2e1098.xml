     Moseley</name>, <name type="organization" key="132">U. S. V.</name>, contributed the specimen
     (<hi rend="initialcap">F</hi>IG. 7), with the following report: &#34;Slightly comminuted
    fracture of both bones of right leg at middle third, followed by copious discharge of sanious
    pus. The patient having become weak and debilitated, tonics and stimulants were resorted to with
    the desired effect. On <date type="operation" when="1863-10-25">October 25th</date>, double-flap
    amputation at the upper third of the leg was performed by <name type="person" key="880">Acting
     Assistant Surgeon W. H. Ensign</name>. Simple dressings and adhesive straps were used. The
    patient did well, and the stump had almost entirely healed, when, on <date type="injury"
     when="1863-11-08">November 8th</date>, h&#230;morrhage supervened. Graduated compresses were
    resorted to without avail, and on <date type="operation" when="1863-11-10">November 10th</date>
    the limb was reamputated at the lower third of the thigh by the double-flap method. The stump
    was again well-nigh healed, when, on November 26th, h&#230;morrhage again set in, and <name
     type="person" key="885">Dr. Mott</name>'s tourniquet was applied with perfect success. On
    December 10th the tourniquet was removed, and no return of the h&#230;morrhage followed. By
    January 18, 1864, the patient was up and about the ward, and doing well. The specimen, a conical
    ball enclosed in a sac, was removed from the amputated leg at the second operation. The patient
    had received this ball in a skirmish with the enemy in Kentucky, in October, 1861, and the
    missile had remained in the popliteal space beneath the outer hamstring tendons, without
    inconvenience, for two years and one month.&#34; The amputated tibia and fibula, showing no
    attempt at union, were contributed by the operator (See <hi rend="italic">Cat. Surg. Sect.</hi>,
    1866, p. 511), and constitute specimen 1744 of the Surgical Section of the <name type="hospital"
     key="431">Army Medical Museum</name>. The patient was subsequently transferred to <name
     type="hospital" key="428">Judiciary Square Hospital</name>, and discharged from service <date
     type="servicedischarge" when="1864-07-30">July 30, 1864</date>. He is a pensioner, and was paid
