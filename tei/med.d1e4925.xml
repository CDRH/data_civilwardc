          was admitted <date type="admit" when="1861-10-10">Oct. 10, 1861</date>, having been
          treated for three days before admission with astringents and nutrients. The attack
          commenced with a chill. On admission he had pain in the head, back and abdomen, a slow and
          feeble pulse, hot and dry skin, heavily coated white tongue with clean tip and slightly
          reddened edges, thirst, slight cough, somewhat labored respiration and scalding during
          micturition. Next day the characteristic eruption came out on the face and abdomen. His
          appetite was improved on the 12th; the tongue natural and the skin perspiring on the 13th.
          Two days later the skin became dry and hot, the tongue white at the base and red at the
          tip and margins, the pulse full, but there was no diarrh&#339;a; next day the febrile
          action abated. On the 22d he was considered convalescent, and on <date type="duty"
            when="1861-11-01">November 1</date> he was returned to duty.&#8212;<hi rend="italic">
