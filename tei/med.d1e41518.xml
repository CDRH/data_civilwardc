Chronic diarrhœa.  [This man appears on the hospital register of his regiment admitted <date type="admit" when="1863-03-25">March 25th</date>—measles—sent to general hospital <date type="transfer" when="1863-04-14">April 14th</date>.]  The patient was feeble and emaciated; he had from six to eight watery stools in the twenty-four hours; abdomen tender and painful; pulse frequent and feeble; tongue dry, red and smooth; no appetite.  Treatment: Stimulants, alteratives, fomentations to the abdomen.  Died, <date type="death" when="1863-05-19">May 19th</date>.  <hi rend="italic">Autopsy:</hi> Body greatly emaciated; abdomen sunken. The lungs were slightly congested. The heart normal. The peritoneum covering the intestines was discolored. The mucous membrane of the ileum was softened; that of the large intestine not materially altered. The liver and spleen were somewhat enlarged. The kidneys were healthy.</p> 
   <p>⃰ It is to be regretted that, in most instances, the records of this hospital do not show by whom the autopsies were made. It is known that many of them were made by <name type="person" key="134">Surgeon Bentley</name> himself, or under his immediate supervision, but it is only possible to distinguish these from the others in a few cases.</p>
