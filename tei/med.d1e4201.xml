                                        night. He felt well on the morning after admission, but
                                        in the evening the pulse became accelerated and strong, the
                                        skin hot and dry and the tongue red, clean at the tip but
                                        coated at the base; he had three stools during the day, with
                                        some soreness of the abdomen, but no tympanites nor
                                        gurgling. Quinine was given. He is reported as having slept
                                        well on the 4th and as having had no chill on the 5th; on
                                        the 6th his condition is not stated.  On the 7th he had
                                        headache and was restless; countenance natural; pulse 86,
                                        steady; skin hot and dry but soft; tongue moist, red and
                                        quite clean; he had pain in the bones, two stools and
                                        abdominal tenderness, but no tympanites. He had one stool on
                                        the 8th. Small doses of calomel, quinine and opium were
                                        given.  The headache was worse on the 9th; there was a
                                        feeling of pressure on the brain with buzzing in the ears
                                        and deafness; four stools were passed; the tongue was dry,
                                        red at the tip, furred in the centre and coated gray at the
                                        base. Sweet spirit of nitre was prescribed.  On the 10th the
                                        bowels were quiet and continued so to the end with but
                                        little complaint of abdominal tenderness or tympanites.
                                        Emulsion of turpentine and Mindererus' spirit were
                                        administered.  On the 11th the skin was hot but moist; the
                                        tongue continued dry and the appetite did not return,
                                        although there was marked improvement in the cerebral and
                                        abdominal symptoms.  On the 15th the patient was restless,
                                        and there was some cough for the first time in the progress
                                        of the case; the cough grew worse, and on the 17th brown
                                        mixture was prescribed. Next day there was anxiety of
                                        countenance and much cough, but neither accelerated
                                        respiration nor pain.  On the 20th the patient was slightly
                                        delirious. Whiskey-punch and citrate of iron and quinine
                                        were given.  On the 22d his face was pale, countenance dull,
                                        pulse 82, steady, surface circulation good, skin dry and
                                        husky but not hot, tongue slightly brown and dry in the
                                        centre, whitish and moist along the sides, red at the tip
                                        and edges, teeth and gums clean; he had some appetite, no
                                        thirst, and a cough with slight wheezing and gurgling sounds
                                        in the lower parts of the lungs; at times also he had some
                                        dizziness and tinnitus.  On the 23d the respiration became
                                        increased to 26; the pulse to 102; the abdomen was soft and
                                        natural.  He died on <date type="death" when="1861-10-29">the 29th</date>. No eruption was noticed in this case.</p>
