    reported that the wounded man was admitted to the field hospital of the 1st division, Second
    Corps, where the missile was extracted. <date type="transfer" when="1864-05-26">Two weeks after
     the reception of the injury</date> he was sent to <name type="place" key="#Washington"

     <date type="transfer" when="1864-05-31">May 31st</date>, the wound being healthy at date of
    admission and continuing so until July 3d, when sloughing set in. This was successfully treated
    by applications of nitric acid, followed by dressings of coal oil, together with internal
    administration of tincture of chloride of iron, porter, and generous diet. By July 12th, the
    wound was again granulating and his general health improving. Complete cicatrization being
    prevented by the presence of dead bone, that portion of the tibia was removed by <name
     type="person" key="xx">Acting Assistant Surgeon D. W. Cadwallader</name>, on <date
     type="operation" when="1864-10-01">October 1st</date>, through an incision over the spine. The
    small fragments of bone were then thoroughly washed out with a syringe and the parts coaptated
    by adhesive plaster, over which simple water dressing was applied. Cicatrization progressed
    rapidly and was complete by <date type="hospitaldischarge" when="1864-10-28">October 28,
     1864</date>, when the patient was discharged from hospital," his term of service having expired

     when="1865-08-22">August 22, 1865</date>, certified to the injury, and stated: "The front of
    the injured leg is covered with delicate blue integument, not perfectly healed. He is unable to
    labor, and an artificial leg would be far preferable." The <name type="organization" key="xx"
     >New York Examining Board</name> reported, <date type="pension" when="1873-09-03">September 3,
     1873</date>: "There has been considerable loss of osseous substance. The entire anterior and
    inner aspect of the middle and upper portion of the leg is covered with encrustations, and there
    is periostitis and necrosis of bone at present." At subsequent examinations the same indurated,
    ulcerated, and partly indolent condition of the parts, interfering with locomotion, was
    reported. The pensioner was paid <date type="pension" when="1879-12-04">December 4, 1879</date>. </p>
