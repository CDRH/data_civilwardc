   <p><hi rend="initialcap">C</hi>ASE 370.&#8212;<name type="person" key="xxx">Private Robert Johnson</name>, <name type="organization" key="xxx">company I, 11th North Carolina (rebel) infantry</name>; admitted <date type="admit" when="1863-08-03">August 3, 1863</date>.  Chronic diarrh&#339;a.  Died, <date type="death" when="1863-08-25">August 25th</date>.  <hi rend="italic">Autopsy</hi> <date type="autopsy" when="1863-08-25">four hours and a half after death</date>: Body greatly emaciated; rigor mortis very strong; apparent age 20; height five feet six inches. The brain was pale, of normal consistence, and weighed forty-six ounces and a half; the veins of the pia mater contained but a small quantity of blood; the lateral ventricles contained a drachm of clear serum. The right lung weighed twelve ounces, the left nine and a half; both lungs were of a grayish-slate color anteriorly, and posteriorly pink with purplish patches; a considerable quantity of dark venous blood escaped from cut surfaces on pressure; the lower lobe of the right lung presented posteriorly a hard spot about two inches in diameter, which extended into the parenchyma about half an inch, and was apparently the result of former inflammation; numerous delicate adhesions were found between the lobes of the left lung. The mucous membrane of the upper part of the &#339;sophagus was very pale, in the lower part it was slightly injected; that of the larynx and trachea was also pale; the spaces between the trachea rings were slightly purple. The trachea contained a small quantity of yellowish-white mucus. The pericardium contained a drachm and a half of clear light straw-colored fluid. There was some emphysema of the cellular tissue surrounding the pericardium. The heart weighed eight ounces and a half; its valves were healthy; the right cavities contained a firm fibrinous clot of a dirty reddish hue, which extended into the superior vena cava and the pulmonary artery; the left ventricle contained a mixed clot. The surface of the liver was light purple with yellowish spots; internally it was of a yellowish chocolate color; its acini were well marked; it weighed forty-seven ounces; its left lobe was very small, (4&#189; &#10005; 2&#189; &#10005; 1 inch;) the gall-bladder contained an ounce and a half of clear straw-yellow bile with a yellowish flocculent sediment. The spleen weighed three ounces and a half; its surface was in part purplish-blue, in part greenish-slate color, the interior was of a chocolate-red; the Malpighian bodies were numerous and well marked; the organ was rather firmer than usual. The pancreas was firm, yellowish-white, and weighed three ounces. The kidneys were pale, and weighed four ounces and a half each; the right kidney presented on its upper part two elliptical cysts about a quarter of an inch in long diameter. The rug&#230; of the stomach were unusually well marked. The mucous membrane of the jejunum and upper part of the ileum was pale; in the lower third of the ileum it presented a purplish appearance, and Peyer's patches were somewhat injected. The c&#230;cum was of a deep-purple color; the whole tract of the large intestine presented numerous minute round ulcers, which were thickly crowded together; in the sigmoid flexure and the rectum were irregular patches of a tawny-green color, varying in size from an inch and a quarter to half an inch in diameter, from which the mucous membrane appeared to be entirely removed.&#8212;<name type="person" key="245">Assistant Surgeon Harrison Allen</name>, <name type="organization" key="190">U. S. A.</name>&#8432;</p>
   <p>&#8432; September 14, 1864, <name type="person" key="245">Dr. Allen</name> presented to the Pathological Society of Philadelphia a brief &#34;<hi rend="italic">Synopsis of Autopsies made at <name type="hospital" key="176">Lincoln General Hospital</name></hi>,&#34; to which the reader is referred.&#8212;(Proceedings of the Pathological Society of Philadelphia, in the American Journal of the Medical Sciences, January, 1865, page 133.)  In this paper he analyzes the appearances observed in forty-one cases of diarrh&#339;a and dysentery, thirty-five of fever, twenty-one of pneumonia, and five of diphtheria. The notes of <name type="person" key="245">Dr. Allen</name>'s autopsies, from which the accounts here presented have been condensed, were not contained in the case-books of <name type="hospital" key="176">Lincoln hospital</name> turned in to the <name type="organization" key="xxx">Surgeon General's Office</name> at the close of the war, but have since been copied into them from the originals, loaned for the purpose.</p>
