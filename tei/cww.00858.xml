                            before the outbreak of our present political
                        difficulties he was offered $800.00 for said servant woman

                        her son&#8212;; that said offers was made by persons not engaged in the

                        were at the time not above the real value of said servants; but as your
                        petitioner had no desire to buy or to sell at any price, he sought no
                        definite information on the subject. The said <persName>Martha</persName> is
                        an excellent Cook, and house servant&#8212;honest and trustworthy, and can
                        always command the highest wages&#8212;she can read and is quite

                    your petitioner's claim to such service or labor.</p>

                <p>Your petitioner further states and alleges, that <seg type="handwritten">his</seg> said claim to the service or labor of said <seg

                    the present rebellion against the Government of the United States.</p>

                <p>And your petitioner prays the said Commissioners to investigate and determine the
                    validity of <seg type="handwritten">his</seg> said claim to the service or labor
                    of said <seg type="handwritten">Servants</seg> herein above set forth; and if
