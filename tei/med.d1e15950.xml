On <date type="operation" when="1864-06-28">June 28th</date>, <name type="person">Acting Assistant Surgeon Ezra Dyer</name> removed two pieces of the orbital ridge. The patient's constitutional

                                                  was some cerebral irritation.  On <date type="operation" when="1864-07-01">July 1st</date>, an
                                                  incision in the scalp was made, and two pieces of
                                                  bone were removed; one the size of a filbert, the
                                                  other as large as a pea. Simple antiphlogistic
                                                  treatment was employed, and the patient progressed
                                                  finely.  On <date type="servicedischarge" when="1865-04-13">April 13th, 1865</date>, he was discharged

                                                  right eye.  A communication from the <name type="person" key="xx">Commissioner of Pensions</name>, dated <date type="pension" when="1868-03-26">March 26th, 1868</date>, states that
