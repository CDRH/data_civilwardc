                        Samuel D. Solomon</name>, <name type="organization" key="189">Co. G, 3d New Jersey Volunteers</name>, was wounded in an engagement at <name type="battle" key="127">Bull Run Bridge</name>,
                        <date type="injury" when="1862-08-27">August 27th, 1862</date>, by a carbine
                    ball, which struck at a point two inches behind the tip of the left ear and
                    produced, apparently, only a scalp wound across the median line. He fell to the
                    ground, but retained his consciousness. When seen by the surgeon, a probe was
                    passed along the track of the missile the depth of two inches into the brain
                    substance.  The patient was sent to the <name type="hospital" key="189">3d
                        division hospital</name> at <name type="place">Alexandria</name>. The extent of the injury was not
                    suspected, and the case was treated as a superficial scalp wound.  On <date type="transfer" when="1862-09-03">September
                        3d</date>, he was admitted to the <name type="hospital">Broad and Cherry Streets Hospital, Philadelphia</name>.
                    Healthy suppuration continued, and a fragment of bone was discharged from the
                    wound.  On <date type="duty" when="1862-11-06">November 6th</date>, the wound had healed, and the patient was returned to
                    duty.  <date type="admit" when="1862-11-08">Two days later</date> he was admitted to the <name type="hospital" key="71">Ryland Chapel Hospital</name>, Washington, suffering from a large abscess
                    in the left ear.  On <date type="transfer" when="1862-12-05">December 5th</date>,
                    he was transferred to the <name type="hospital" key="175">Stanton Hospital</name>. The discharge from the ear had not altogether ceased, and
                    he was suffering constant headache, which was greatly increased by exposure to
                    cold air; he also suffered from acute darting pains across the base of brain,
                    from the right temple to the scar of the wound. No paralysis existed and the
                    functions of the body were generally well performed. The cicatrix, though
                    tender, was firm. After a few days, he was allowed, at his own request, to serve
                    in the capacity of nurse; but, in two weeks' time, he was relieved from this
                    task, as the pain and vertigo were unduly increased, and he was becoming pale
                    and emaciated.  He was discharged the service <date type="servicedischarge"
                        when="1863-01-19">January 19th, 1863</date>.  <name type="person" key="70">Surgeon John A. Lidell</name>, <name type="organization" key="132">U. S. V.</name>, who reports the case, states, that it was the opinion of several
                    surgeons, who examined the injury, that the missile still lodged in the cranial
                    cavity.  On <date type="pension" when="1870-03-02">March 2d, 1870</date>, his claim for pension was still pending, and his
                    disability rated three-fourths and probably permanent.</p>
