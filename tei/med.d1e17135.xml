      <p><hi rend="initialcap">C</hi>ASE.&#8212;<name type="person">Lieutenant Charles
          Kennedy</name>, <name type="organization">Co. I, 28th Pennsylvania Volunteers</name>, aged
        25 years, was wounded at the battle of <name type="BATTLE" key="257">Chancellorsville,
          Virginia</name>, <date type="injury" when="1863-05-02">May 2d, 1863</date>, by a fragment
        of shell, which produced a wound two inches long and one inch wide, removing the superior
        portion of the occipital bone one inch to the right of the median line, destroying the
        membranes so that the substance of the brain protruded about one and a half inches. On <date
          type="admit" when="1863-05-07">May 7th</date>, he was admitted to <name type="hospital"
          >Armory Square Hospital</name>, Washington. The wound had a burnt and black appearance,
        and the pulsation of the brain was very distinct with every beat of the heart. The patient's
        intellect was greatly impaired, and there was total loss of vision, so that he could not
        distinguish day from night. The pulse was at 60 and full, and there was partial loss of
        power in the lower extremities. After admission to hospital, the hair was closely shaven
        around the wound, and the dead tissue was removed by sponging with tepid water. His bowels
        were constipated for seven days from the date of the injury, and he had scarcely any sleep.
        Cathartics, injections, and anodynes were administered. On <date type="injury"
          when="1863-05-11">May 11th</date>, twelve leeches were applied to each temple, and three
        behind each ear. On the following day the symptoms were greatly ameliorated. On <date
          type="operation" when="1863-05-13">May 13th</date>, spicul&#230; of bone were removed, and
        also on <date type="operation" when="1863-05-15">the 15th</date>, when the fungus had
        receded somewhat, and a healthy granulation was progressing. His appetite was good, no
        fever, vision partially restored, and able to get out of bed. He continued to improve, and
        on June 16th the fungus had entirely retracted, and vision was restored. The intellect was
        perfect and the general health good. On <date type="furlough" when="1863-06-20">June
          20th</date>, <name type="person">Lieutenant Kennedy</name> went home on leave of absence.
        He was subsequently admitted to the <name type="hospital">Officers' Hospital at
          Philadelphia</name>. On <date type="injury" when="1863-09-09">September 9th, 1863</date>,
        the wound had entirely healed. On <date type="duty" when="1863-11-12">November 12th</date>,
        he was ordered before an examining board at <name type="place">Annapolis</name>, and was
        returned to duty <date type="duty" when="1864-01-12">January 12th, 1864</date>. On <date
          type="admit" when="1864-05-05">May 5th, 1864</date>, he was admitted to the field hospital
        at <name type="place">Lookout Mountain</name>, being again returned to duty about <date
          type="duty" when="1864-07">July, 1864</date>. He was discharged the service <date
          type="servicedischarge" when="1864-07-20"> July 20th, 1864</date>, and afterward
        pensioned. <name type="person">Pension Examiner Wilson Jewell</name>, under date of <date
          type="pension" when="1865-04-19">April 19th, 1865</date>, reported that the patient
        suffers from cephalalgia, vertigo, and weakness, when exposed to the sun or much excited.
        His disability was rated one-third and temporary. It was subsequently stated by <name
          type="person">Dr. C. C. McGlaughlin</name>, late surgeon <name type="organization">95th
          Pennsylvania Volunteers</name>, that he attended <name type="person">Lieutenant
          Kennedy</name> in his last illness, and that he died <date type="death" when="1865-12-15"
          >December 15th, 1865</date>, from the effects of a wound in his head. The plate opposite
        illustrates the appearance of the wound in <date type="injury" when="1863-05">May and June,
          1863</date>. </p>
