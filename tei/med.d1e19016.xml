                                                  musket ball, which entered the right side, passed
                                                  deeply beneath the muscles of the lumbar region

                                                  fracturing both, and completely dividing the cord.
                                                  He was admitted from the field to <name type="hospital" key="175">Stanton Hospital</name>, Washington. There was complete paralysis
                                                  of the lower extremities, relaxation of the anal
                                                  sphincter, and retention of urine. The temperature
                                                  of the body was below the normal standard; the

                                                  with a tendency to congestion. The ball was

                                                  catheter. Cold-water dressings were applied to the

                                                  administered. On May 13th, the patient grew worse.
                                                  He complained of pain in the track of the ball,
                                                  fever and great restlessness. The wound did not
                                                  discharge feely, and the urine dribbled away. On
                                                  May 15th, there was an augmentation of the above
