     A. Robbins</name> reported: "He was admitted to <name type="hospital" key="171">Armory Square
     Hospital</name>, having been wounded by a conoidal ball, which entered the anterior aspect of
    the right thigh at a point above the junction of the middle and lower thirds, producing
    comminuted fracture, and made its exit at a point on the posterior surface opposite to that of
    entrance. The limb was treated in Hodgen's splint without extension. During the month of <date type="operation" when="1865-03">March, 1865</date>, several spiculæ of bone were removed,
    varying in size, the longest being two and a half inches in length. These were extracted without
    enlarging the opening. The patient came under my care June 1, 1865. The bone is now united with
    five and a half inches shortening. The femur is bowed out and the foot is considerably inverted.
    The knee joint is considerably stiffened, so that it can only be flexed to an angle of about
    twenty degrees. About one ounce of healthy pus is now discharged during twenty-four hours. The
    patient's health is very good." On <date type="photo" when="1865-07-06">July 6th</date> he was
    brought to the <name type="hospital" key="431">Army Medical Museum</name>, when the photograph,
    shown in the cut (<hi rend="initialcap">F</hi>IG. 149), was taken. On <date type="transfer" when="1865-07-07">the following day</date> he was transferred to the Ira Harris Hospital at

     Surgeon J. H. Armsby</name>, <name type="organization" key="132">U. S. V.</name>, contributed a
    cast of the injured limb (<hi rend="italic">Cat. Surg. Sect.</hi>, 1866, p 535, <hi rend="italic">Spec.</hi> 1356). The patient was discharged from service <date type="servicedischarge" when="1863-10-03">October 3, 1863</date>, and pensioned. <name type="person" key="xx">Examiner S.

     1873</date>: "The ball entered five inches above the knee, anteriorly, fracturing the femur,
    and splitting, with two points of emergence, on the posterior aspect of the thigh. Result: Stiff
    knee; femur curved outward at an angle of twenty degrees," etc. At a subsequent examination
    substantially the same was reported. The pensioner was paid <date type="pension" when="1879-03-04">March 4, 1879</date>.</p>
