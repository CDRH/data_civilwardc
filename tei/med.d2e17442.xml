    Creek</name>, <date type="injury" when="1864-05-30">May 30, 1864</date>. He was admitted to <name type="hospital" key="172">Emory Hospital</name>, Washington, <date type="admit" when="1864-06-08">June 8th</date>, with &#34;shot wound of left leg, over tibia.&#34;  <name type="person" key="1228">Acting Assistant Surgeon A. McLetchie</name> contributed a specimen (<hi rend="italic">Cat. Surg. Sect.</hi>, 1866, p. 519, <hi rend="italic">Spec</hi>. 3133), with the following
    report: &#34;The wound was caused by a mini&#233; ball, which entered the leg directly over the spine of the tibia, middle third, injuring
    the periosteum but not splintering the bone itself. The missile was extracted through the wound of entrance. The wounded
    man was admitted to Patterson Park Hospital, <name type="place">Baltimore</name>, <date type="transfer" when="1864-06-11">June 11th</date>. He was in a very asthenic condition, and I ordered stimulants and good nourishing diet. About <date type="injury" when="1864-06-18">the 18th of June</date> gangrene set in, manifesting itself by constitutional symptoms, fever, loss of appetite, etc., some days before the distinctive symptoms appeared in the wound. The disease was treated with nitric acid,
    cautery, dressings of chlorinate of soda, linseed poultices, charcoal, turpentine, and linseed oil, with frequent use of the syringe.
    On August 11th, he was returned from the gangrene ward with the wound much enlarged, but entirely free from gangrene, and
    nearly four inches of the bone exposed. Tincture of chloride of iron was administered daily, and milk punch, from the first
    appearance of the disease. Diarrh&#339;a, which had been checked on his entrance into the hospital, now set in again, complicated
    with acute dysentery, and was treated with chalk mixture, vegetable astringents, and pulverized iron and opium. But the
    patient gradually wasted away from the steady strain on his system, and died <date type="death" when="1864-08-26">August 26, 1864</date>.&#34; The specimen is a wet preparation of the leg, showing a contusion in the middle third of the tibia, and necrosis extending up the shaft of the bone on its posterior surface to near its head, also two openings from ulceration in the lower third.</p>
