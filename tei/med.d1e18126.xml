                                                  œsophagus had taken place. The ball had barely
                                                  escaped the lateral process of the atlas. There
                                                  was an effusion of blood into the muscles of the
                                                  neck, causing compression, doubtless, on important
                                                  nerves. No manifest cause for his sudden death was
                                                  discovered. The pathological specimen is No. 1239,
                                                  Sect. I, A. M. M., showing the left superior
                                                  maxilla and a part of the malar bone fractured by
                                                  a musket ball, which carried away the upper part
                                                  of the body and the orbital process and the
                                                  zygomatic process of the malar broken off at its
                                                  root. The pathological specimen of the fractured
                                                  humerus is No. 1238, Sect. I, A. M. M. The
