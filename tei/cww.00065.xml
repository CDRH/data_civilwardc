                    <!-- This section represents a piece of paper pasted onto what we've defined as the petition cover, so I've added the transcription of this surface here. Also, I've handled the names of the women listed differently from a typical <persName>. Since the title "Mrs." functions somewhat as a first name in the list below, I've included the title within the <persName> tag. Typically we transcribe such modes of address outside the <persName> tag. However, in this case, it seems important to record that the petitioner is listing Franck Taylor's wife, not Franck Taylor here. Including "Mrs." as part of the <persName> is one, but perhaps not the best, way of doing so. This portion of the markup may need to be revised. JC, 2011-11-30.-->
