     Bowen</name>,&#185; <name type="organization" key="455">Co. A, 27th Indiana</name>, aged 19
    years, was wounded at <name type="BATTLE" key="33">Antietam</name>, <date type="injury"
     when="1862-09-17">September 17, 1862</date>. He was taken to <name type="place"
     >Frederick</name> and admitted to No. 1 hospital on <date type="admit" when="1862-09-24"
     >September 24th</date>. <name type="person" key="xx">Acting Assistant Surgeon J. C.
     Shimer</name> records the following: "A conoidal ball had entered the outer aspect of the left
    thigh about five inches above the knee, fractured the femur, and passed out directly opposite.
    Buck's apparatus was applied. On October 19th, considerable amount of callus had been thrown
    out, and there was some union; his appetite and general condition were good. <date
     type="operation" when="1862-10-23">October 23d</date>, a deep but circumscribed abscess on the
    outer side of middle third of thigh was opened and evacuated. <date type="operation"
     when="1862-10-30">30th</date>, both the wounds of entrance and exit were enlarged to evacuate
    pus more freely. December 5th, he has improved greatly; passive motion has been employed to
    overcome stiffness of the knee." On March 18, 1863, he was able to walk with the aid of
    crutches, and the wounds had nearly healed. A slight attack of erysipelas yielded readily to
    treatment. May 21st, the wound took on a gangrenous condition, for which strong nitric acid was
    applied. On <date type="transfer" when="1863-06-15">June 15th</date>, he was transferred to
    Baltimore. The wounds looked healthy and his general condition was excellent. He entered the
    Jarvis Hospital on <date type="admit" when="1863-06-16">the 16th</date>, and was discharged
     <date type="servicedischarge" when="1863-09-07">September 7, 1863</date>. The femur had only
    partially united; the sciatic nerve was injured; his leg was partially and his foot entirely
    paralysed. He received a pension, and was employed as a clerk in the <name type="organization"
     key="xxx">Interior Department</name>. Owing to a recurrence of abscesses he entered the <name
     type="hospital" key="446">Providence Hospital</name>, Washington, in the <date type="admit"
     when="1867">autumn of 1867</date>, and, on <date type="operation" when="1867-11-11">November
     11th</date>, the limb was amputated in the middle third by <name type="person" key="123">Dr. D.
     W. Bliss</name>, late Surgeon <name type="organization" key="132">U. S. V.</name> The wound
    healed well, and a photograph was taken at the <name type="hospital" key="431">Army Medical
     Museum</name> on <date type="photo" when="1868-01-09">January 9, 1868</date>, at which time the
    stump was firm and healthy. The specimen was contributed to <name type="hospital" key="431">the
     Museum</name> by <name type="person" key="123">the operator</name>, and is No. 4914, Surgical
    Section. The fragments are considerably overlapped, having undergone unusual disturbance, and
    the amount of callus exceeds what is necessary for complete union. On <date type="pension"
     when="1871-03-10">March 10, 1871</date>, the patient was a clerk in the <name
     type="organization" key="xxx">Pension Office</name>; the stump was healthy but his general
    health poor. He died <date type="death" when="1878-03-17">March 17, 1878</date>, of phthisis
    pulmonalis.</p>
