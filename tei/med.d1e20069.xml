                                                  aged 17 years, received a shell wound of the right
                                                  side of the chest at <name type="BATTLE" key="xxx">Petersburg, Virginia</name>, <date type="injury" when="1864-06-17">June
                                                  17th, 1864</date>; the eighth rib was fractured at its
                                                  centre, and the seventh and ninth ribs denuded on

                                                  division hospital of the Ninth Corps, where simple
                                                  dressings were applied. On <date type="transfer" when="1864-06-20">June 20th</date>, he was
                                                                transferred to <name type="hospital" key="165">Mount Pleasant Hospital</name>,
                                                  Washington. When admitted, the patient s general
                                                  health was good. There was slight inflammatory
                                                  action in the integuments immediately about the
                                                  wound. The fractured ends of the rib did not
                                                  interfere with the action of the pleura. June 24th: Inflammation subdued, but no efforts at
                                                  granulations; stimulant injections and resin
                                                  cerate dressings. On June 30th, physical signs of
                                                  pneumonia made their appearance, localized about
                                                  the seat of injury. <date type="operation" when="1864-07-04">July 4th</date>, pneumonia resolved.
                                                  Wound and adjacent tissues in a sloughing
                                                  condition. Secondary h&#230;morrhage occurred from the
                                                  intercostal artery, which could not be secured on
                                                  account of the mass of slough. The wound was
                                                  thoroughly injected with tincture of muriate of
                                                  iron and plugged with lint saturated with the
                                                  same. The slough still advancing, the patient was
                                                  etherized on <date type="operation" when="1864-07-08">July 8th</date>, and the wound was
                                                  thoroughly cauterized with nitric acid; a yeast
                                                  and charcoal poultice was then applied. The
                                                  remainder of the slough came away on July 12th;
                                                  h&#230;morrhage recurred, and, the artery eluding
                                                  search, the treatment of the 4th was successfully resorted to.
                                                  The outer ends of the fractured rib were found to
                                                  have caused irritation by their friction motion on
                                                  the pleura; and, on <date type="operation" when="1864-07-15">the 15th</date>, <name type="person" key="xxx">Acting Assistant Surgeon F. S. Barbarin</name> administered an an&#230;sthetic
