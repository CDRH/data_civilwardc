                                        looked dull; his pulse 90, quick and strong, skin normal and

                                        the bowels; the abdomen was covered with dark spots
                                        (vibices?) and showed a few rose-spots, which latter
                                        disappeared on pressure; he was delirious.  Emulsion of
                                        turpentine was given every two hours, tincture of iron three
                                        times daily and beef-essence as required.  Five involuntary
                                        stools were passed on the 3d, and astringents were
                                        administered. The passages were frequent but passed
                                        voluntarily on the 4th; the abdomen and chest were covered
                                        with dark-colored spots imperceptible to the touch and
                                        disappearing on pressure; the tongue was dry and brown and
                                        there was some hoarseness. The stools became again
                                        involuntary on the 5th, and the teeth and lips covered with
                                        sordes. The patient's face was congested, eyes dull, skin
                                        hot and showing the remains of the dark-red spots. He had
                                        anorexia, slight tympanites and iliac tenderness; pulse 100.
                                        Beef-essence and punch were ordered, with Dover's powder in
                                        the evening. Involuntary micturition and defecation, with
                                        much tenderness, were noted on the 6th; pulse 112. The
                                        tongue was clean, red and dry on the 7th; the appetite
                                        improved and there was but one stool. During the three or
                                        four days which followed the tongue became moist and flabby,
                                        with prominent papill&#230;; the appetite continued to
                                        improve; the bowels were quiet, but there was much umbilical and some iliac tenderness.  On the 12th the pulse fell from 110 to 80, the
                                        eyes became bright and the delirium ceased. Next day the
                                        tongue was moist and clean and the appetite good; but until
                                        the end of the month flabbiness and prominent
                                        papill&#230; were reported. The patient was free from
                                        diarrh&#339;a, but the abdomen was occasionally tender;
                                        at times he had headache.  He was transferred to <name type="place">Annapolis,
