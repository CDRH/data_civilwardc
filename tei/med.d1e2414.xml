                                        he was very weak and did not sleep, tho eyes dull, cheeks
                                        flushed, pulse 85, skin hot, chest and abdomen covered with

                                        thirst, extreme tenderness of the abdomen and tympanites
                                        although but one stool was passed; there was also some
                                        cough. Quinine and turpentine emulsion were prescribed. Next
                                        day the tongue became dry in the centre; on the 2d there was
                                        epistaxis, and on the 3d headache and inability to sleep,

                                        at the edges. Beef-essence and milk-punch were prescribed,
                                        and as there had been no movement of the bowels for some
                                        days, castor oil was given; the abdomen was tympanitic and
                                        tender and gurgled under pressure. The tongue became moist
                                        on the 6th, the skin moist on the 7th, but free perspiration
                                        did not occur until the 16th, when the appetite returned.
                                        The headache became relieved about the 10th, at which time
                                        the last crop of the eruption faded. The patient was able to
                                        be up on the 25th, and was transferred to <name type="place">Baltimore</name> on <date
