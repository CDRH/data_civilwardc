               <p>To the Commissioners under the act of Congress approved the
                        <date when="1862-04-16">16th of April, 1862</date>, entitled "An act for the
                    release of certain persons held to service or labor in the <placeName>District
                        of Columbia</placeName>."</p>

                <p>
                  Your Petitioner, <persName>Benjamin B. Burr</persName> of the
                    City of <placeName>Washington</placeName> by this his petition in writing,
                    represents and states, that he is a person loyal to the <placeName>United
                        States</placeName>, who, at the time of the passage of the said act of
                    Congress, held a claim to service or labor against a certain person of African
                    descent of the name of <persName>William Prather</persName> for and during the
                    life of said <persName>William Prather</persName> and that by said act of
                    Congress said <persName>William Prather</persName> was discharged and freed of
                    and from all claim of your petitioner to such service or labor; that at the time
                    of said discharge, said <persName>William Prather</persName> was of the age of
                    Twelve years and of the personal description following in color he was black and
                    in stature was about four feet three inches, and of no bodily or mental defects
                    or infirmities.</p>

                <p>
                  That your petitioner acquired his claim to the aforesaid
                    service or labor of said <persName>William Prather</persName> in manner
                    following by marriage with <persName>Sarah R. Offut</persName> formerly of
                        <placeName>Washington County</placeName>. State of
                        <placeName>Maryland</placeName> in the month of November last.</p>

                <p>
                  That your petitioner's claim to the service or labor of said
                        <persName>William Prather</persName> was, at the time of said discharge
                    therefrom, of the value of Five hundred dollars that the said <persName>William
                        Prather</persName> was a smart active and intelligent boy and an honest and
                   industrious

                    house servant and waiter; and your petitioner avers that he knows of no infirmities or defects, morally, bodily or mentally of the said <persName>William Prather</persName> and verily believes none to exist.</p>
               
               <p>Your petitioner hereby declares that he bears
                        true and faithful allegiance to the Government of the <placeName>United States</placeName>, and
                        that he has not borne arms against the <placeName>United
                        States</placeName> in the present rebellion, nor in any way or manner given aid or comfort
                        thereto, but on the contrary your petitioner enlisted in one of the volunteer companies raised in this City at the inception of this rebellion and served faithfully his term of service.</p>
               
               <p>And your petitioner further states and alleges, that 
                            he has not brought said <persName>William Prather</persName>
                            into the <placeName>District of Columbia</placeName> since the passage of said act of Congress; and
                            that, at the time of the passage thereof, said <persName>William Prather</persName> was held to service or labor therein under and by virtue
                        of your petitioner's claim to such service or labor.</p>

                <p>
                  Your petitioner further states and alleges, that his said claim to the service or labor of said <persName>William Prather</persName> does not originate in or by virtue of
                        any transfer heretofore made by any person who has in any manner aided or
                        sustained the present rebellion against the Government of the United
                        States.</p>

                <p>
                  And your petitioner prays the said Commissioners to investigate and determine
                        the validity of his said claim to the service or
                        labor of said <persName>William Prather</persName> herein above set forth;
                        and if the same be found to be valid, that they appraise and apportion the
                        validity of said claim in money and report the same to the Secretary of the
                        Treasury of the <placeName>United States</placeName>, in conformity to the provisions
