      <p><hi rend="initialcap">C</hi>ASE.—<name type="person">Sergeant Presley W.
          N——</name>, <name type="organization">Co. C, 1st Ohio Volunteer
        Cavalry</name>, aged 24 years, was wounded near <name type="battle">Culpeper,
          Virginia</name>, <date type="injury" when="1863-09-13">September 13th, 1863</date>, by a
        musket ball, which comminuted both tables of the left temporal bone two inches above the
        mastoid process. He was conveyed to <name type="place" key="#Washington">Washington</name>,
        and admitted into <name type="hospital" key="171">Armory Square Hospital</name> on<date type="admit" when="1863-09-15">the 15th</date>, where simple dressings were applied to the
        wound. The head symptoms were very slight until <date type="injury" when="1863-10-07">October 7th</date>; from that time he gradually grew worse. On <date type="operation" when="1863-10-17">the 17th</date>, nausea and vomiting supervened. An incision was made
        over the cicatrix by <name type="person">Surgeon D. W. Bliss</name>, <name type="organization" key="132">U. S. V.</name>, and several small spiculæ of bone were
        removed, which, however, afforded no relief, and the vomiting, with increased pain in head,
        continued. The patient sank rapidly, and died on <date type="death" when="1863-10-20">the
          20th</date>. The <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> examination revealed the vessels of
        the membranes and of the brain in a high state of congestion. An abscess was found in the
        left ventricle, which communicated with the external wound, and contained an ounce of dark,
        greenish pus. The substance of the brain in the vicinity of the abscess was softened.
        Communication existed between the external wound and the abscess, which was filled with
        spiculæ. The pathological specimen is represented in the adjacent wood-cut. The edges
        of the fracture in the cranium are somewhat rounded, exhibiting evidence of attempts at
        repair. The specimen and history were contributed by <name type="person">Surgeon D. W.
          Bliss</name>, <name type="organization" key="132">U. S. V.</name>
