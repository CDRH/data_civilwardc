                                        the damp ground. The swelling began on the day following the
                                        exposure and gradually increased. He had a cough and a
                                        syphilitic eruption on the skin; his urine was albuminous.
                                        He was treated with diuretics, diaphoretics, iron and other
                                        tonics.  On Feb. 4, 1865, Rochelle salt, in a daily dose of
                                        one ounce, was prescribed.  On the 11th he was much worse,
                                        being somewhat comatose, the pulse frequent and feeble,
                                        the urine scanty and dark-colored, showing under the

                                        oil-globules. Tincture of digitalis in ten-drop doses was
                                        given every three hours.  On the 13th the pulse was stronger
                                        and the mind clear, but the anasarca had become general and
                                        there was considerable ascites. Bromine was ordered on the
                                        18th for a bed-sore which had appeared.  The stools became
                                        involuntary on the 22d and the breathing difficult on the
                                        26th.  He died <date type="death" when="1864-03-01">March 1</date>.   <hi rend="italic">Post-mortem</hi> examination: All the

                                        contained sixteen pints. The right kidney weighed ten
