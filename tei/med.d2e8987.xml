      Miller</name>, <name type="organization" key="336">Co. G, 116th Pennsylvania</name>, aged 18
     years, was wounded at the <name type="BATTLE" key="12">Wilderness</name>, <date type="injury" when="1864-05-05">May 5, 1864</date>, and admitted to <name type="hospital" key="171">Armory
       Square Hospital</name>, Washington, <date type="admit" when="1864-05-26">three weeks afterwards</date>. <name type="person" key="123">Surgeon D. W. Bliss</name>, <name type="organization" key="132">U. S. V.</name>, described
     the injury as a "fracture of the upper third of the left femur, caused by a minié ball," but
     the progress of the case, further than an attack of pleuro-pneumonia, in March, 1865, was not
     reported. On <date type="transfer" when="1865-08-15">August 15, 1865</date>, the patient was
     transferred to <name type="hospital" key="173">Harewood Hospital</name>, whence <name type="person" key="158">Surgeon R. B. Bontecou</name>, <name type="organization" key="132">U. S. V.</name>, reported the following history: "When admitted he was convalescent from a wound
     of the thigh, the missile entering and fracturing the femur at the junction of the upper and
     middle thirds, passing through and coming out on the inner side, near the tuberosity of the
     ischium. According to the patient's statement his constitutional condition at the time of the injury was very good, although the wound was very
     painful. Severe hæmorrhage followed the injury, with great tumefaction of the whole limb.
     The fracture box was used and counter-extension, and the treatment was supporting throughout.
     The patient had so far recovered as to be able to be about on crutches. The thigh had shortened
     about two inches and three-fourths; but otherwise the man was in good condition and in a fair
     way of having a useful limb." Two weeks afterwards he was transferred to <name type="hospital" key="xx">Mower Hospital</name>, and subsequently to the Post
     Hospital at <name type="place">Philadelphia</name>, and in October he was finally sent to <name type="place">Harrisburg</name> to be
     mustered out, his term of service having expired <date type="servicedischarge" when="1865-07-14">July
      14, 1865</date>. An apparatus for the injured limb was furnished on <date type="injury" when="1865-12-06">December 6, 1865</date>, by <name type="person" key="xx">J. M. Gemrig</name>, of <name type="place" key="xx">Philadelphia</name>. <name type="person" key="xx">Dr. J. A. McArthur</name>, Surgeon of the
     <name type="hospital" key="xx">Soldiers Home, Philadelphia</name>, <date type="pension" when="1866-10-17">October 17, 1866</date>, certified
     to anchylosis of the knee joint as resulting from the injury, and described the wound as still
     open and requiring treatment. The <name type="organization" key="xx">Philadelphia Examining
      Board</name> reported "almost complete anchylosis of the knee," in September, 1873, and two
     years afterwards <name type="organization" key="xx">the same Board</name> stated: "The femur is
     curved antero-posteriorly—concavity forward. There are several scars on the front of the thigh,
     where spiculæ were removed, and the muscular structure of the thigh is much wasted. He
     alleges constant pain in walking." The pensioner was paid <date type="pension" when="1879-06-04">June 4, 1879</date>. A photograph of the
     patient, taken at the <name type="hospital" key="173">Harewood Hospital</name> in <date type="photo" when="1865-10">October,
