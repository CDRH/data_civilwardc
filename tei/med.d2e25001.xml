     type="organization" key="541">Co. A, 10th Massachusetts</name>, was kicked by a mule in the
    left leg, fracturing both bones, while driving ambulance at <name type="place">Camp
     Brightwood</name>, <date type="injury" when="1861-08-31">August 31, 1861</date>. He was
    admitted to the <name type="hospital" key="154">Washington Infirmary Hospital</name> on <date
     type="admit" when="1861-08-31">the day of the injury</date>. <date type="operation"
     when="1861-10">One month after the accident</date> no attempt at union of the bone had yet
    taken place, but much suppuration had occurred and the bone had become bare in its whole
    circumference for the space of two inches. Free incisions were made anteriorly and posteriorly
    and resection of the tibia and fibula was performed. Firm union resulted three months after the
    operation, a gypsum apparatus being used during the last month. The patient was discharged from
    service <date type="servicedischarge" when="1861-12-17">December 17, 1861</date>, and sent home.
    He had urgently requested that amputation be performed, but on careful examination it was deemed
    more prudent to saw off the dead bone which had not yet been cast off and to resort to
    amputation only in case of failure of the resection. The excised portion of the tibia (<hi
     rend="italic">Spec.</hi> 346), represented in the adjacent cut (<hi rend="initialcap">F</hi>IG.
    368), and measuring one and one-fourth inches in length, was contributed with the history of the
    case by <name type="person" key="287">Assistant Surgeon J. W. S. Gouley</name>, <name
     type="organization" key="190">U. S. A.</name> The patient became a pensioner after receiving
    his discharge. <name type="person" key="xx">Examining Surgeon H. D. Train</name>, of <name
     type="organization" key="xx">Sheffield, Massachusetts</name>, <date type="pension"
     when="1872-09-07">September 7, 1872</date>, certified to the injury and resection, "shortening
    the limb three inches. There is a perfect solidification at the place of fracture; no motion of
    ankle and instep. After slight exertion or during damp weather he has often severe pain, which
    prevents any labor. Since his discharge he has been obliged to lead a sedentary life from
    inability to walk. His general health is fair, but his system is generally weakened and
    sensitive to cold weather. The foot is gradually perishing, and the pensioner would have been
    infinitely better off to-day if amputation had been performed." Five years later <name
     type="person" key="xx">the same examiner</name> reported that "since last examination
    spicul&#230; of bone were frequently discharged, the wound breaking out afresh. He cannot walk
    any distance without crutch or cane. General health poor." The pensioner was paid <date
