     key="xx">Fort Steadman</name>, <date type="injury" when="1865-03-25">March 25, 1865</date>. He
    was conveyed to the Ninth Corps field hospital, whence <name type="person" key="1079">Assistant
     Surgeon S. Adams</name>, <name type="organization" key="190">U. S. A.</name>, contributed the
    pathological specimen (<hi rend="italic">Cat. Surg. Sect.</hi>, 1866, p. 321, <hi rend="italic"
     >Spec</hi>. 3998), with the following history: "The injury consisted of a shell wound of the
    right leg below the knee joint, tearing open the joint, passing across and smashing the patella
    of the left leg. <name type="person" key="123">Surgeon L. W. Bliss</name>, <name
     type="organization" key="440">51st New York</name>, amputated both thighs at the lower third on
     <date type="operation" when="1865-03-25">the day of the injury</date>. By April 1st the
    patient's general condition was excellent, his appetite and pulse good, and his tongue clean."
    The specimen consists of the amputated lower extremity of the left femur, with fragments of the
    patella. From the field hospital the patient was sent to <name type="place">City Point</name>,
    and thence to <name type="place" key="#Washington">Washington</name>, where he was admitted to
     <name type="hospital" key="171">Armory Square</name>, and subsequently to <name type="hospital"
     key="176">Lincoln Hospital</name>. <name type="person" key="243">Surgeon J. C. McKee</name>,
     <name type="organization" key="190">U. S. A.</name>, in charge of the latter, contributed the
    photographs, represented in the annexed wood-cuts (<hi rend="initialcap">F</hi>IGS. 182, 183),
    and described the amputation as a flap operation. The patient was released and discharged from
    hospital <date type="hospitaldischarge" when="1865-08-02">Aug. 2, 1865</date>. Subsequently he
    entered and was treated for a time at St. Luke's Hospital, <name type="place">New York
     City</name>, where, on <date type="pension" when="1866-02-28">February 28, 1866</date>, he was
    provided by <name type="person" key="xx">Dr. E. D. Hudson</name> with artificial limbs, by means
    of which he was enabled to walk, requiring the assistance of two canes only.</p>
