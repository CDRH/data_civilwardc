The irritation seems to have extended to the bladder, and if he stands he has a constant desire to urinate; any heavy lifting produces pain and <choice><orig>fulness</orig><reg>fullness</reg></choice> in this region. He also has pain at the seat of the fracture, which has recently increased, probably owing to some necrosed spiculæ of bone. He says that he can perform no hard labor which requires standing or lifting."  He was last paid on <date type="pension" when="1872-12-04">December 4, 1872</date>.</p>
