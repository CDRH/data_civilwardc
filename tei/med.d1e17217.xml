                                                  by a conoidal ball, which struck the <hi rend="italic">os frontis</hi>,
                                                  one inch above the edge of the right orbit, and
                                                  about half an inch from the median line. He was
                                                  rendered insensible for a few moments, but soon
                                                  recovered sufficiently to walk from the field. He
                                                  was admitted to <name type="hospital" key="94">Cliffburne Hospital</name>, Washington,
                                                                on <date type="admit" when="1862-06-15">the 15th</date>. The wound was healthy in appearance,
                                                  and discharged a thin, sero-purulent fluid; the
                                                  pulsation of the brain was distinctly visible, and
                                                  splinters and loose fragments of bone could be
                                                  felt. Absolute quiet was enjoined, and light diet
                                                  and simple dressing, with aperients, ordered. On

                                                  enlarged the wound of entrance, and removed the
                                                  fragments of bone with forceps. The ball could not
                                                  be found, it having evidently entered the brain.
                                                  The wound was left open, and lightly dressed with
                                                  wet lint. The patient felt better the next day.
                                                  The second day after operation, he complained of
                                                  slight, persistent pain in the back of the head,
                                                  which continued until <date type="operation" when="1862-06-20">the 20th</date>, when a small
                                                  fungus growth made its appearance in the wound.
                                                  Suppuration, which had previously been profuse and
                                                  healthy, was much diminished, and the pain
                                                  increased. The fungus was readily detached with
                                                  the handle of the scalpel, and its removal gave
                                                  exit to an ounce of pus, which somewhat relieved
                                                  the pain. Hernia cerebri again appeared on the
                                                  27th, and death took place on the evening of <date type="death" when="1862-06-28">the

                                                  could answer questions correctly up to an hour
                                                  before his death. The autopsy revealed the ball,
                                                  much fissured and twisted upon itself, lying in a
                                                  sac of false membrane, about one inch beneath the
                                                  dura mater. The whole anterior lobe was broken
                                                  down, and of a pultaceous consistence, dark
                                                  sanious pus filling the ventricular cavity. The
                                                  adventitious tissue, which formed the bulk of the
                                                  hernia and the cyst containing the ball, was soft,
                                                  and under the microscope was seen to be composed
                                                  of interlacing fibres, containing large cells in
                                                  its meshes. The history of the case was
