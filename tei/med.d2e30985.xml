E, 93d Pennsylvania</name>, aged 35 years, was wounded <date type="injury" when="1865-03-25">March 25, 1865</date>, in an assault on <name type="place">Fort Steadman</name>, in the lines about <name type="place">Petersburg</name>. <name type="person" key="xxx">Surgeon S. F. Chapin</name>, <name type="organization" key="xxx">139th Pennsylvania</name>, reported his admission to the hospital of the 2d division of the Sixth Corps, with "a slight gunshot wound of the right arm by a minié ball."  The patient was transferred to the Sixth Corps depot hospital at <name type="place">City Point</name>, where <name type="person" key="xxx">Assistant Surgeon J. S. Ely</name>, <name type="organization" key="132">U. S. V.</name>, reported:  "A gunshot flesh-wound of the right forearm."  The patient was sent, <date type="transfer" when="1865-03-27">March 27, 1865</date>, on the <name type="hospital" key="xxx">hospital transport "State of Maine"</name> to <name type="place" key="#Washington">Washington</name>, and entered <name type="hospital" key="152">Finley Hospital</name>, <date type="transfer" when="1865-03-29">March 29, 1865</date>. The wound, as reported by <name type="person" key="xxx">Acting Assistant Surgeon C. J. Polk</name>, who has published an account of the case,¹ was regarded as trivial for more than a week. Pyæmic symptoms supervened. It was discovered that the joint was affected with suppurative inflammation, and on <date type="operation" when="1865-05-06">May 6, 1865</date>, <name type="person" key="72">Surgeon G. L. Pancoast</name>, <name type="organization" key="132">U. S. V.</name>, excised the joint, "removing an inch of the humerus and the half of the head of the radius, and the olecranon process of the ulna."  The preparation (<hi rend="initialcap">F</hi>IG. 638) was presented to <name type="hospital" key="431">the Museum</name> by <name type="person" key="72">Dr. Pancoast</name> (<hi rend="italic">Cat. Surg. Sect.</hi>, 1866, p. 154). There has been no fracture of the articular extremities, but ulceration and destruction of the cartilages evidently
    existed. There is a transverse section of the humerus above the trochlea, half an inch from the point at which the bone was ultimately sawn.  The case progressed favorably, and the patient was discharged <date type="servicedischarge" when="1865-08-01">August 1, 1865</date>, and pensioned.  <name type="person" key="xxx">Examiner M. D. Benedict</name>, of <name type="place" key="#Washington">Washington</name>, reported, <date type="pensions" when="1865-08-01">at that date</date>:  "He had compound comminuted fracture (!!) of the right elbow joint: the entire joint was removed by excision; limb entirely useless for labor."  <name type="person" key="xxx">Examiner W. B. Lowman</name>, of <name type="place">Johnstown, Pennsylvania</name>, reported, <date type="pension" when="1873-09-06">September 6, 1873</date>:  "Resection of right elbow joint; the limb is two inches shorter than its fellow; the arm is but of little use; he cannot grasp anything with his hand.  Address, Scalp Level, <name type="place">Cambria County, Pennsylvania</name>."</p>
