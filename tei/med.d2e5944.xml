   <p><hi rend="initialcap">C</hi>ASE 259.—<name type="person" key="960">Lieutenant <hi rend="italic">D. N. Patterson</hi></name>, <name type="organization" key="397">46th
     Virginia</name>, aged 31 years, was wounded at an engagement on the <name type="BATTLE" key="114">Boydton Plank Road</name>, near <name type="place">Petersburg</name>, <date type="injury" when="1865-03-29">March 29, 1865</date>, and was captured and sent to <name type="place">City Point</name>, and immediately conveyed on an hospital transport to <name type="place" key="#Washington">Washington</name>, and placed in <name type="hospital" key="171">Armory Square Hospital</name> on <date type="admit" when="1865-04-02">April 2d</date>. On
    examination, it was found that a conoidal ball had entered the left thigh behind the trochanter
    major, and had passed inward and forward, fracturing the trochanter, neck, and head of the
    femur, and the anterior border of the acetabulum. On <date type="operation" when="1865-04-03">the day after the patient's admission</date>, five days subsequent to the reception of the
    injury, <name type="person" key="123">Surgeon D. W. Bliss</name>, <name type="organization" key="132">U. S. V.</name>, in charge of the hospital, decided that the case was one in which
    excision of the upper extremity of the femur was applicable. The wounded man was anxious that an
    operation should be performed, and his general condition was very satisfactory. On April 3d he
    was placed under the influence of chloroform, and <name type="person" key="123">Surgeon
     Bliss</name> exposed the fractured bone by a curvilinear incision with its convexity forward.
    The shattered fragments of the neck were extracted, the rent in the capsular ligament was
    enlarged and the round ligament was divided, and the head of the femur was exarticulated. It was
    found that the ball had not only comminuted the head, neck, and great trochanter, but that
    fissures extended down the shaft of the femur. The bone was divided by the chain saw two inches
    below the trochanter minor. The deep wound was now washed out, and small fragments of bone were
    removed, and search was made for the ball. It was finally detected by means of a Nélaton
    probe deeply buried in the obturator muscle near the posterior margin of the obturator foramen.
    The operation was accomplished with little loss of blood, and the patient reacted
    satisfactorily. The wound was lightly dressed, sufficient outlet for discharges being left, and
    the limb was extended and supported by pillows. Careful nursing was provided, and such
    stimulants and concentrated nourishment as seemed best adapted to the patient's condition. For
    three days he progressed very satisfactorily. Notwithstanding the extensive lesions of the
    pelvis, which were not detected until after death, there was no indication of peritonitis or
    disturbance of the urinary organs. On <date type="death" when="1865-04-07">April 7th</date>,
    however, profuse hæmorrhage took place, which could not be controlled, and the patient died
    on the morning of that day. At the autopsy it was found that the bleeding had proceeded from the
    internal iliac vein, gradually worn away by a sharp bit of bone forced inward by the ball. The
    pathological specimen, represented in the adjoining wood-cut (<hi rend="initialcap">F</hi>IG.
    67), is also figured at page 246 of the Catalogue of the Surgical Section of the <name type="hospital" key="431">Army Medical Museum</name>, where another view is given.</p>
