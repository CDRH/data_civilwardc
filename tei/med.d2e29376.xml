When he was admitted to <name type="hospital" key="156">Seminary Hospital</name>, Georgetown, <date type="admit" when="1864-05-14">four days afterwards</date>, he was in a rapidly sinking condition, and the injured limb was gangrenous from the elbow down, owing to the circulation
    having been stopped by applying bandages too tight on the field. On <date type="operation" when="1864-05-15">May 15th</date> the arm was amputated above the elbow joint
    by <name type="person" key="xxx">Surgeon H. W. Ducachet</name>, <name type="organization" key="132">U. S. V.</name>, who performed the operation by skin flaps and circular section of muscles. Chloroform
    constituted the anæsthetic.  The patient began to improve within forty-eight hours after the amputation, and, with the exception
    of the formation of two abscesses in the stump, his improvement continued slowly afterwards. About June 30th he was able to
    walk about, and <date type="furlough" when="1864-07-21">three weeks later</date> he left the hospital on leave of absence. The history of the case was reported by <name type="person" key="xxx">the operator</name>.  <name type="person" key="xxx">The Adjutant General</name>, <name type="organization" key="190">U. S.
