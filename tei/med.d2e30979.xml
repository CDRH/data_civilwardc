V.</name>, reported the patient's admission to Mower Hospital <date type="transfer" when="1863-05-10">May 10th</date>, with the following description of the injury and operation:  "Gunshot wound of left elbow, shattering internal condyle and olecranon process. Resection was performed, by a straight incision, on <date type="operation" when="1863-07-11">July 11th</date>, by <name type="person" key="xxx">Acting Assistant Surgeon C. R. McLean</name>. The treatment consisted of stimulants and anodynes, and cold-water dressings.  On July 29th, the splints were removed and the arm placed on a pillow.  September 2d, wound healing rapidly.  December, 1863, wound nearly well."  The specimen, represented in the annexed wood-cut (<hi rend="initialcap">F</hi>IG. 636), shows the excised bones of the elbow, consisting of the head of the radius, the olecranon and coronoid processes, and one inch of the shaft of the ulna and two inches of the extremity of the humerus, all the structures being changed by caries and partially absorbed. It was contributed by <name type="person" key="xxx">the operator</name>.

In <date type="pension" when="1865-09">September following</date>, he was furnished with an apparatus by D. W.
