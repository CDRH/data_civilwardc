    admitted to <name type="hospital" key="175">Stanton Hospital</name> with compound fracture of
    the lower third of tho right femur. Resection of a portion of the bone was performed on <date type="operation" when="1863-05-19">May 19th</date>, before admission to this hospital. The
    wound suppurated profusely, and his condition was unfavorable. Water dressings were used, and
    Hodgen's splint was applied to the limb. Six ounces of whiskey were administered daily. There
    was no attempt at union of the bone and no abatement of the discharge. By July 2d the patient
    had become pale, anæmic, and emaciated, when muriated tincture of iron was prescribed in
    doses of twenty drops three times a day. The patient was also troubled with anorexia, and on
    July 5th diarrhœa came on, for which astringents, consisting of opium and tannin, and
    subsequently tincture of catechu and opium, were administered. Death occurred on <date type="death" when="1863-07-10">July 10, 1863</date>." A section of the injured femur was
    contributed by <name type="person" key="70">Surgeon J. A. Lidell</name>, <name type="organization" key="132">U. S. V.</name>, and is shown in the wood-cut (<hi rend="initialcap">F</hi>IG. 171). The specimen exhibits considerable deposit of callus,
    imprisoning the necrosed fragments but not uniting the extremities.</p>
