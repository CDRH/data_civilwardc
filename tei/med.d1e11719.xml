                by a musket ball which struck the forehead. He was made a prisoner and admitted to
                the hospital of the Ninth Army Corps at <name type="place">City Point</name>. On
                    <date type="transfer" when="1865-03-27">March 27th</date> he was conveyed in the

                ridge, apparently indicted by a glancing musket ball. There were no cerebral
                symptoms when the patient was admitted, and he seemed to be doing well for several
                days, being quite free from pain or any febrile movement. The pulse was normal and
                the bowels in good condition. On <date type="injury" when="1865-04-01">April
                    1st</date>, he complained of a dull deep-seated pain over the left eye. Later in
                the day he was feverish and restless, his countenance was pale, and his pulse slow
                and weak. On April 2d, he failed rapidly. On the night of the 3d, he was delirious.
                On the 4th, there was violent raving, which continued until his death, on the
                afternoon of <date type="death" when="1865-04-05">April 5th, 1865</date>. At the
                post-mortem examination, a fissure was found extending into the right orbit, and
                upward beyond the left frontal prominence. The vitreous table beneath was largely
                depressed. There was a small abscess in the anterior lobe of the left cerebral
                hemisphere. The specimen was contributed by <name type="person" key="1479">Acting
                    Assistant Surgeon J. P. Arthur</name>, and is represented in the accompanying
                wood-cuts, (Fig. 77 and Fig. 78.) Two fragments of the inner table are driven inward
                to the depth of half an inch, touching each other by their inner edges like the
                leaves of a folding door just ajar. (See <hi rend="italic">Catalogue Surg.
