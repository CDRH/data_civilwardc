                                        Iowa</name>; age 26; was admitted <date type="admit" when="1865-02-04">Feb. 4, 1865</date>, with coryza,
                                        cough and slight fever. During his stay in hospital he had
                                        some obscure symptoms which culminated in a chill followed
                                        by suppuration in the glands of the left groin. These were
                                        open and discharging when, on April 4, he complained of
                                        great pain in the back and loins. An eruption appeared on
                                        his forehead on <date type="injury" when="1865-04-10">the 10th</date> and spread during the next two days
                                        over his abdomen, back, legs and arms; his pulse was
                                        accelerated and weak; stomach irritable and general
                                        condition low.  On the 11th there was epistaxis and vomiting
                                        of blood, sordes on the teeth and increased frequency of
                                        pulse, 130.  He died <date type="death" when="1865-04-12">next day</date>, the vomiting continuing to the
                                        last; blood was passed from the bladder shortly before
                                        death.  <hi rend="italic">Post-mortem</hi> examination <date type="autopsy" when="1865-04-13">fifteen hours after death</date>: Rigor mortis slight; cellular
                                        tissues full of serum; eruption slightly umbilicated. The
                                        lungs were congested posteriorly. The heart was flabby, its
                                        right side and large vessels filled with liquid blood and
                                        some soft and reddish-brown clots. The liver and spleen were
                                        softened. The solitary follicles were prominent and on
                                        puncture exuded a whitish serum; those near the
                                        ileo-cæcal valve presented a distinct black spot in
                                        a central depression. The kidneys appeared normal but the
                                        bladder was filled with blood.—<hi rend="italic"><name type="hospital" key="162">Douglas
