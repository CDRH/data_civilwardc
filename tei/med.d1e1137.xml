                                                Cav.</name>; age 36; was admitted <date type="admit" when="1864-10-27">October 27, 1864</date>, with a
                                        contusion of the left side caused by the kick of a horse. He
                                        was feeble; the spleen was much enlarged, occupying nearly
                                        the whole of the left lumbar region and parts of the
                                        umbilical and left inguinal region, He had suffered from
                                        ague eight years before for fourteen months, the disease
                                        intermitting occasionally for about a week at a time. After
                                        admission his appetite was variable, and he lost flesh
                                        although his bowels were regular. He was treated with
                                        citrate of iron and quinia, stimulants and nourishing diet.
                                        He was able to be about the ward and out of doors;
                                        occasionally he had some cough. About noon on <date type="death" when="1864-12-31">December 31</date> he
                                        became speechless and unable to swallow. He died at 6 P.M.  <hi rend="italic">Post-mortem</hi> examination: No
                                        rigor mortis. The brain was normal; its membranes somewhat
                                        adherent to the medulla and pons. The right cavities of the
                                        heart were distended and a greenish-white, soft, almost
                                        pus-like clot floated in the ventricle. The right lung was
                                        somewhat congested and adhered by old firm fibrinous bands;
                                        the left lung was congested by hypostasis; one or two glands
                                        at the root of the left lung contained cheesy and chalky
                                        matters. The liver was large and bloodless; its portal veins
                                        filled with soft yellow clots. The spleen weighed
                                        sixty-eight ounces and adhered to the diaphragm and stomach;
                                        its veins contained soft greenish clots; a secondary spleen
                                        the size of an unhusked walnut was found at the head of the
                                        pancreas. The mesenteric glands were indurated and about the
                                        size of a pea. The ileum and colon were normal. The
                                        psoæ muscles were softened and their surfaces
                                        blackened. The external iliac arteries contained blood. The
                                        kidneys were white and fatty. Microscopically the greenish-white
                                        clots of the heart and blood vessels consisted of granules
                                        and polynucleated cells, many of the latter a little larger
                                        than a blood corpuscle, but the majority much
                                                larger.—<hi rend="italic"><name type="hospital" key="189">Third Division
