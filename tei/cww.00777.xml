                    <p>Your Petitioner, as administrator of the Estate of his late father Major
                            <persName>Parke G. Howle</persName>, held at the time of the passage of
                        the said Act of Congress a claim to service or labor against <persName><hi rend="underline">William Shorter</hi></persName>; <persName><hi rend="underline">Ann Shorter</hi></persName> wife of

                        African descent and slaves for life, and states that by the said act of
                        Congress the said persons were discharged and freed from all claim of your
                        Petitioner to such service or labor.</p>
                    <p>Your Petitioner gives the following description of said Persons,
                            <persName>William Shorter</persName> is about forty or forty two —
                        years of age, of a dark brown <note type="marginal" subtype="handwritten"><persName>Mr Fenwick</persName> has been dead 4 or 5 years

                        about twelve years ago by my Father of the late <persName>Edward
                            Fenwick</persName> of this <placeName>District</placeName>, by whom
                            <persName>William</persName> was raised. <persName>William</persName> is
                        an invaluable servant, honest faithful, willing and obliging. He is a good
                        carriage driver &amp; hostler, and having up to the time of his purchase,
                        worked on a farm, understands farming &amp; gardening. He has had some
                        experience within the last 2 years as a House Servant
                        
                        <pb xml:id="leaf001v" facs="cww.00777.002.jpg"/>
                        
                        In view of the above, he is invaluable as a
                        first class servant about a gentlemans house or farm. I am not aware that he
                        has any physical defect. His health is very good.</p>
                    <p><persName>Ann Shorter</persName>, wife of <persName>William</persName> is
                        about <persName>William</persName>'s age.— of a dark brown color She has been
                        brought up as a family servant and is a very superior cook and understands
                        the thousand and one things that make up the knowledge of a House Servant.
                        She was raised by my Father. Has had seven children I am not aware that she
                        has any defect in body or health further than her own statement that she is
                        occasionally troubled with rheumatism.</p>
                    <p><persName>Rebecca</persName> daughter of <persName>William</persName> &amp;
                            <persName>Ann</persName> is five years of age, of a dark brown color, is
                        a smart active girl. She has no defect that I am aware of in body or
                        health.</p>
                    <p>I estimate their value as follows which I consider a low valuation <list>
                            <item><persName>William Shorter</persName> worth one thousand
                                dollars.</item>
                            <item><persName>Ann Shorter</persName> worth nine hundred dollars</item>
                            <item><persName>Rebecca Shorter</persName> worth five hundred and fifty
                                dollars. Two years ago, as such servants were selling, I could have
                                obtained a much higher price for them.</item>
                        </list>
                    </p>
                    <p>Your Petitioner further declares his allegiance to the Government of the
                            <placeName>United States</placeName> and that he has not born arms
                        against the

                        <placeName>United States</placeName> during the present rebellion, nor in any
                        way given aid or comfort thereto</p>
                    <p>Your Petitioner further declares that the above named persons were not
                        brought into the <placeName>District of Columbia</placeName> after the
                        passage of the above Act of Congress, and that at the time of the passage
                        thereof, they were held to service or labor therein under and by virtue of
                        your petitioners claim to such service or labor.</p>

                    <p>Your Petitioner further declares that his said claim to the service or labor
                        of said persons does not originate in or by virtue of any transfer
                        heretofore made by any person who has in any manner aided or sustained the
                        present rebellion against the Government of the <placeName>United

                <p>To the Commissioners under the Act of Congress approved the <date when="1862-04-16">16th of April 1862</date>, Entitled "An act for the
                    release of certain persons held to service of labor in the <placeName>District
                        of Columbia</placeName>.</p>
                <p>Gentlemen</p> <p>I ask permission to file this paper as a supplement to the Petition
                    filed by me <date when="1862-06-28">June 28, 1862</date>. As Administrator of
                    the estate of my late Father Major <persName>Parke G. Howle</persName> claiming
                    compensation for <persName>William Shorter</persName>, <persName>Ann
                        Shorter</persName> and <persName>Rebecca Shorter</persName> persons of
                    African descent, and slaves for life, freed by the passage of the said act, and
                    that it may form part of the same. Whereas in said petition &amp; claim I have
                    inadvertently omitted to state for whose special benefit I have filed the same,
                    and as it seems to me proper that it should be so specified, although from the
                    language of the act it does not appear to be required. Now therefore by these
                    presents, I affirm that I have filed said petition &amp; claim as administrator
                    aforesaid for the sole use &amp; benefit of <persName>Augustine N. Y.
                        Howle</persName>, son &amp; heir of the late <persName>Parke G.
                        Howle</persName> who has been absent for the period of some four or five
                    years or more and that I have not heard of or from my Brother the said
                        <persName>Augustine</persName>, directly or indirectly, for the period of
                    some four years, and that when last heard from he was in the <placeName>State of
                        California</placeName>, and further I have no reason to believe that he was
                    ever borne arms against the <placeName>United States</placeName> during the
                    present rebellion or in any way given aid or comfort thereto As evidence of his
                    absence I ask leave to submit the accompanying certificate of
