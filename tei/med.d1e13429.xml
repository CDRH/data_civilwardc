                    of the parietal and occipital bones.  He was admitted to the hospital of the 1st
                        division, Sixth Corps. He was delirious, and would allow no clothing upon him.
                    At times, he would not eat; at others, his appetite was ravenous. He passed his
                    urine involuntarily, but retained his f&#230;ces. His memory was totally lost. On
                    examination, no depression about the circumference of opening was discovered.
                    Expectant treatment was used, and on <date type="injury" when="1863-06-01">June 1st</date>, the patient was much improved. He
                    ate regularly, slept, and his memory gradually returned; but he misplaced words
                    and coined new ones.  On <date type="transfer" when="1863-06-12">June
                    12th</date>, he was sent to <name type="hospital" key="171">Armory Square

                        when="1864-06-23">June 23d, 1864</date>, he was discharged the service and
                    pensioned, his disability being rated one-half; and since, up to <date type="injury" when="1869-09-30">September 30th,
                        1869</date>, he has suffered from occasional attacks of epilepsy.</p>
