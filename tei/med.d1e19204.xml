          T&#8212;&#8212;</name>, <name type="organization">Co. D, 5th New Jersey Volunteers</name>,
        aged 46 years, was admitted to <name type="hospital" key="167">Carver Hospital</name>,
        Washington, on <date type="admit" when="1863-05-09">May 9th, 1863</date>. He had been
        wounded, on <date type="injury" when="1863-05-03">the 3d</date>, at the battle of <name
          type="BATTLE" key="257">Chancellorsville</name>. The shock to the system had been very
        severe. He was conveyed to the 1st division hospital of the Third Corps, and his wound,
        attended by great laceration of the soft parts, was dressed under the direction of <name
          type="person">Surgeon J. S. Jamieson</name>, <name type="organization">86th New York
          Volunteers</name>. When he rallied he was sent to <name type="place" key="#Washington"
          >Washington</name> on an hospital transport steamer. A fragment of shell had struck the
        back, over the right scapula, causing a compound comminuted fracture. The wound was closed
        with sutures, and a linseed poultice applied; the patient was allowed sixteen ounces of wine
        in the twenty-four hours, and half diet. Brandy and quinia were subsequently prescribed.
        Death occurred on <date type="death" when="1863-05-12">May 12th, 1863</date>. At the
        autopsy, the tissues surrounding the wound were found to be involved to a very considerable
        extent; serous effusion had taken place, and a collection of pus was found below the neck of
        the scapula. The extent of the injury to the bone is shown in the adjoining wood-cut (<hi
          rend="initialcap">F</hi>IG. 212). The spine and a large portion of the dorsum of the
        scapula are carried away, and a fissure extends into the glenoid cavity. The extremity of
        the acromion process, separated from its attachments, is present, but is misplaced in the
        cut. The specimen was contributed to the <name type="hospital" key="431">Army Medical
          Museum</name>, with the history, by <name type="person" key="102">Surgeon O. A.
          Judson</name>, <name type="organization" key="132">U. S. V.</name>
