S. Stebbins</name> notes a "gunshot wound of the chest, involving the kidney" and states that "the patient had suffered so much from the wound previous to his admission that he was very badly reduced; there was also paralysis of the bladder and lower extremities. He was constantly delirious, and had involuntary discharges for several days, both from the bowels and bladder. Stimulants, tonics, and nourishing diet were given, and a grain each of acetate of lead and opium was administered to control internal h&#230;morrhage. Sulphate of morphia in solution to allay pain, and strychnine to overcome the paralysis of the bladder, were also given. He continued to fail in strength rapidly, and died on <date type="death" when="1864-09-05">September 5, 1864</date>, from complete exhaustion."  The injury was on the right side. </p>
