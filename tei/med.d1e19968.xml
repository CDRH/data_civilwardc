          A&#8212;&#8212;</name>, <name type="organization" key="xxx">Co. F, 25th Massachusetts
          Volunteers</name>, aged 25 years, was wounded at <name type="BATTLE" key="263">Cold
          Harbor, Virginia</name>, <date type="injury" when="1864-06-03">June 3d, 1864</date>; a
        conoidal ball entered the left axilla and lodged at the posterior border of the scapula. He
        was taken to the field hospital of the 2d division, Eighteenth Corps, where the <date
          type="operation" when="1864-06">ball was removed</date> and simple dressings were applied.
        On <date type="transfer" when="1864-06-11">June 11th</date>, he was transferred to <name
          type="hospital" key="176">Lincoln Hospital</name>, Washington. On <date type="operation"
          when="1864-06-15">the 15th</date>, intermediary h&#230;morrhage to the amount of about
        twenty ounces occurred, probably from some branch of the axillary artery. The wound was
        dilated and a small artery, probably one cut in dilating the wound, ligated. The wound was
        filled with lint saturated in a solution of persulphate of iron, and a compress applied. The
        axillary artery could be distinctly felt with the finger, pulsating in the wound. Pulse
        regular, but weak; patient looked pale. Anodynes and stimulants were administered. On the
        next day h&#230;morrhage again occurred, which yielded to strong pressure on the compress.
          <date type="operation" when="1864-06-17">June 17th</date>, 10 A. M.: Patient very pale,
        an&#230;mic, and suffering from much pain in the arms and shoulder. The compress and
        plugging were removed, when the blood gushed out alarmingly. The wound was freely dilated
        and the axillary artery ligated. The h&#230;morrhage stopped and at the same time the <date
          type="death" when="1864-06-17">heart ceased to beat</date>. The necropsy showed the
        axillary largely opened about the middle of its course, on the side next to the track of the
        ball. There had evidently been sloughing through nearly the whole calibre of the artery. The
        adjacent wood-cut (<hi rend="initialcap">F</hi>IG. 254) represents a preparation of the left
        axillary artery, with a large and deep ulceration, involving nearly half of the cylinder of
        the vessel, about an inch above the origin of the subscapularis. It was contributed, with a
        history of the case, by <name type="person" key="xxx">Acting Assistant Surgeon W. L.
          Herriman</name>. </p>
