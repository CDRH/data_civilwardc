    accident on <date type="injury" when="1862-04-03">April 3, 1862</date>, and was admitted to hospital at <name type="place" key="#Alexandria">Alexandria</name> <date type="admit" when="1862-04">several days afterwards</date>. Surgeon J. E. Summers,
    U. S. A., described the injury as a "transverse fracture of the sternum between the articulations of the third and fourth ribs,
    with displacement, the fractured ends sliding upon each other and shortening the bone one and a half inches. From the posteriorly curved condition of the spinal column there is reason to think that there was crushing of the first and second dorsal
    vertebræ, although there was no paralysis of any of the limbs or organs. The patient is much crippled in appearance, but is
    evidently recovering, although slowly, with considerable deformity."  The patient was discharged for disability resulting from
    his injury <date type="servicedischarge" when="1862-06-16">June 16, 1862</date>. He is not a pensioner.</p>
