      Leichty</name>, <name type="organization" key="486">Co. F, 8th Pennsylvania Reserves</name>,
     aged 21 years, received a shot fracture of the fibula of the left leg, at <name type="BATTLE" key="3"><choice><orig>Spottsylvania</orig><reg>Spotsylvania</reg></choice></name>, <date type="injury" when="1864-05-11">May 11, 1864</date>. <name type="person" key="xx">Surgeon L. W. Read</name>, <name type="organization" key="132">U. S. V.</name>,
     reported that he was admitted to the field hospital of the 3d division, Fifth Corps, where "resection was performed by <name type="person" key="xx">Surgeon T. Jones</name>, <name type="organization" key="486">8th Pennsylvania
     Reserves</name>."  <name type="person" key="905">Assistant Surgeon A. Ingram</name>, <name type="organization" key="190">U. S. A.</name>, contributed the following history: "The wounded
     man entered <name type="hospital" key="428">Judiciary Square Hospital</name>, Washington, <date type="transfer" when="1864-05-18">May 18th</date>. About six inches of the injured fibula had been
     excised on the field. Secondary h&#230;morrhage occurred from the posterior tibial artery to
     the amount of thirty-two ounces, when the vessel was ligated in the wound. By June 14th the
     patient was progressing well. Cold-water dressings were used, and milk punch and a supporting
     treatment was administered." The patient was subsequently transferred to hospital at <name type="place">Alexandria</name>, whence he was discharged from service <date type="servicedischarge" when="1865-01-11">January 11, 1865</date>, and pensioned.   <name type="person" key="xx">Examining Surgeon J. McCullock</name>, of <name type="place" key="xx">Huntingdon, Pennsylvania</name>, <date type="pension" when="1867-04-18">April 18, 1867</date>, described the wound, and added that the "leg has sloughed largely and discharged a number of pieces of bone, the last one about three weeks ago. Since that time the wound has
     healed; tendons back of knee contracted; walks lame; wound painful," etc. <name type="person"
      key="xx">Examiner A. B. Brumbaugh</name> reported, in <date type="pension" when="1877">1877</date>, that, as a result of the resection, "The
     foot cannot be planted even, as it would turn outward from the want of fibular support, and he
     has to keep his shoe blocked up accordingly to support the foot. The toes of the left foot tend
     to turn downward, like hooks, from injury to the nerves and muscles. The leg is not quite but
     almost useless for all purposes of manual labor." The pensioner was paid <date type="pension" when="1880-03-04">March 4, 1880</date>.</p>
