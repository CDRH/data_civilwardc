                                                  was extracted at the lower edge of the middle of
                                                  the eighth rib. When wounded, he had in his
                                                  coat-pocket a letter containing a quantity of hog's bristles, a looking-glass cased in a wooden
                                                  frame, and a gutta-percha comb, portions of all of

                                                  times, extracted from the wound, large portions of
                                                  the looking-glass case being extracted at four
                                                  different points in the course of the ball. When
                                                  admitted, the patient was much prostrated, having
                                                  been exposed to all the inclemencies of the
                                                  season, without rations for several days, and
                                                  transported in an army wagon some forty miles. He
                                                  lingered for a long time at the point of death,
                                                  and exhibited some symptoms of py&#230;mia, of which
                                                  there were many cases in the hospital at that
                                                  time, but, aided by constant care, together with
                                                  the liberal exhibition of tonics and stimulants,
                                                  with extra diet, the powers of nature overcame the
                                                  prostration, and he recovered so far as to receive
                                                  a furlough to go to <name type="place">Philadelphia</name> on the <date type="furlough" when="1864-05-18">18th of
