                                                  appeared; the right pleural cavity became full of

                                                  downward and toward the right side, comminuting,

                                                  the twelfth rib on the right side. The right
                                                  thoracic cavity was partially filled with
                                                  dark-colored offensive serum; the lung was
                                                  covered posteriorly with a large layer of lymph.
                                                  There was no consolidation of the lung, but it was
                                                  stained, of a dirty greenish color externally, and
                                                  was softened within. The pleura was lacerated by
                                                  fragments of bone, and several spicul&#230; were
                                                  removed from the thoracic cavity. The pathological
                                                  specimen is No. 3524, Section I, A. M. M., and
                                                  consists of the sixth, seventh, eighth, ninth, and
                                                  tenth dorsal vertebrae. The right transverse
                                                  processes of the seventh and eighth are carried
                                                  away, and a fragment of the ninth is chipped off.
