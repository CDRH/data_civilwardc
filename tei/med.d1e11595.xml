                                29; enlisted <date type="enlisted" when="1862-08-01">Aug. 1, 1862</date>, and was sent to <name type="place">Camp Convalescent</name>, near <name type="place">Alexandria, Va.</name> Here he took cold by sleeping on the ground with insufficient covering, and was so ill as
                                        to be for a time under treatment in one of the general
                                        hospitals.  In <date type="injury" when="1862-10">October</date>, having joined a portion of his regiment which was then in Washington, he was severely jolted in
                                        trying to mount an unruly horse. The injury seemed to him to
                                        be somewhere in the abdominal walls.  <date type="transfer" when="1862-11">About a month afterward</date> he was sent to <name type="place">Philadelphia</name> to this hospital. On admission, <date type="admit" when="1862-11-12">November 12</date>, he was a good deal debilitated;
                                        pulse rapid; tongue coated; expression of pain on his face;
                                        great tenderness with marked tympanites of the abdomen, and
                                        diarrh&#339;a recurring every few days; appetite fair. He was
                                        treated with tonics, cod-liver oil, anodynes and nourishing
                                        diet.  In January, 1863, he was put on digitalis as his pulse
                                continued to range above 130.  On <date type="servicedischarge" when="1863-02-20">February 20</date>, when he was
                                        ordered to be discharged, his abdominal symptoms had left
                                        him and he was in good condition otherwise, except that his
                                        pulse remained over 120, rising to 174 when he walked to the
                                        end of the ward and back. I was unable to define accurately
                                        the source of the mischief in this case. The patient had
                                        not, according to his own account, had a distinctly <choice><orig>malarious</orig><reg>malarial</reg></choice> fever, nor had he while under my care a fully
                                        developed peritonitis. His heart was in no respect abnormal
                                        except in its irritability, which did not seem to arise from
                                        the state of the blood, nor was there any evidence of disease in any other organ.&#8212;<hi rend="italic"><name type="person" key="xx">Act.
