   <p>Case from the case-book of the <name type="hospital" key="501"><hi rend="initialcap">T</hi>HIRD <hi rend="initialcap">D</hi>IVISION</name> of the <name type="place" key="#Alexandria"><hi rend="initialcap">A</hi>LEXANDRIA</name> <hi rend="initialcap">H</hi>OSPITAL, <name type="person" key="134">Surgeon Edwin Bentley</name>, <name type="organization" key="132">U. S. V.</name>, in charge:&#8432;</p>
   <p><hi rend="initialcap">C</hi>ASE 534.&#8212;<name type="person" key="xxx">Private Calvin Burdick</name>, <name type="organization" key="xxx">company F, 31st Illinois volunteers</name>; age 22; admitted from regimental hospital near <name type="place">City Point, Virginia</name>, <date type="admit" when="1865-05-10">May 10, 1865</date>.  Diarrh&#339;a.  Had been sick several weeks; was suffering from diarrh&#339;a, and was somewhat emaciated and much debilitated, though he was able to sit up and walk about a little.  <date type="death" when="1865-05-11">The day after admission</date>, while walking out of doors, he suddenly fell to the ground, was carried into the ward, and expired a few minutes after.  <hi rend="italic">Autopsy</hi> <date type="autopsy" when="1865-05-12">twenty-four hours after death</date>: An abundant deposit of tubercles was found in both lungs; they were not softened, and were somewhat more numerous in the upper than in the lower portions of the lungs, and in the left lung than in the right. The heart was soft and small, but otherwise normal. The liver and spleen were apparently normal. The mesenteric glands were enlarged, but contained no tubercular matter. The mucous membrane of the intestines was congested. The kidneys pale, but otherwise normal.</p> 
   <p>&#8432; It is to be regretted that, in most instances, the records of this hospital do not show by whom the autopsies were made. It is known that many of them were made by <name type="person" key="134">Surgeon Bentley</name> himself, or under his immediate supervision, but it is only possible to distinguish these from the others in a few cases.</p>
