                                                                hospital of the 3d division, Ninth Corps, where
                                                  fragments of the parietal, temporal, and frontal
                                                  bones were removed, and the flaps united by a
                                                  slight suture.  On <date type="transfer" when="1864-07-03">July 3d</date>, he was sent to
                                                  <name type="place" key="#Washington">Washington</name>, and entered <name type="hospital" key="173">Harewood Hospital</name> on <date type="admit" when="1864-07-04">the 4th</date>, being somewhat uneasy but not complaining of pain. The pulse was slightly accelerated, tongue
                                                  clean, and appetite good. Upon removing the suture the wound was found to be full of maggots. The
                                                  dura mater was exposed for a space about three
                                                  inches in circumference, and of a greenish color;
                                                  the pulsations of the brain were distinctly
                                                  visible.  On <date type="operation" when="1864-07-06"><date type="injury" when="1864-07-06">the 6th</date></date>, the flaps became gangrenous
                                                  and were entirely destroyed. The wound was
                                                  healthy, but the external layer of the dura mater
                                                  was sloughing. Flax-seed poultices were applied.
                                                  The upper margin of the wound granulated finely.
                                                  An incision was made, and a dressing of
                                                  chlorinated soda was employed. The granulation of
                                                  upper margin continued healthy.  On <date type="operation" when="1864-07-28">July 28th</date>,
                                                  secondary hæmorrhage occurred from the left
                                                  temporal artery, which was ligated; about ten
                                                  ounces of blood having been lost. From that time
                                                  the wound assumed a healthy appearance. Small
                                                  pieces of bone were removed as they became
