                                                  headache and nausea; the right eye was injected,
                                                  but the tongue, pulse, and bowels were normal. A
                                                  portion of the frontal bone was depressed, and the
                                                  pulsations of the brain could be seen fluctuating
                                                  up and down the fissures of the fracture. It being
                                                  feared that the depressed portions might irritate
                                                  the dura mater and give rise to inflammation, and
                                                  in view also of the constant headache, the skull
                                                  was trephined on <date type="operation" when="1862-07-11">the 11th</date> by <name type="person">Acting Assistant Surgeon David W. Cheever</name>, and two large pieces and
                                                  some splinters of depressed bone were removed. At
                                                  one point the dura mater had a depression as if
                                                  made by the passage of the ball; otherwise it
                                                  looked uninflamed and healthy, but there was some
                                                  effusion of blood. Water dressings and low diet
                                                  were ordered. On the second day after the

                                                  about, but no fever existed. There was
                                                  considerable discharge of laudable pus. The brain
                                                  was still seen pulsating on the 15th, but not so
                                                  plainly as before. On <date type="injury" when="1862-07-20">the 20th</date>, his condition was
                                                  every way favorable; the pulse quiet, tongue
                                                  clean, skin cool, appetite good, no pain in head,
