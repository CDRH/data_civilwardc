                                                  amount of subarachnoid effusion; the brain
                                                  substance in the region of the wound was very soft
                                                  and pulpy; the left lobe of the cerebellum was
                                                  softened, and on its external surface was a
                                                  deposit resembling pus. A similar deposit was also
                                                  observed in the medulla and upper portion of the
                                                  spinal cord.  The pathological specimen is No.
                                                  2891, Sect. I, A. M. M.  One inch of the
                                                  supra-orbital arch is carried away, and the
                                                  opening involves one square inch of the external
                                                  table. The opening internally is a little larger,
                                                  part of the orbital plate is absent, the frontal
                                                  sinus is opened, and a fissure extends inward to
                                                  the cribriform plate of the ethmoid. The bone
                                                  immediately around the opening is cribriform, and
                                                  is covered with a thin chalky layer of new
                                                  formation.   The specimen was contributed by <name type="person" key="246">Acting Assistant Surgeon H. M. Dean</name>.</p>
