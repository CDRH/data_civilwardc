            <p>Amid the dullness, together <lb/>with the heat and dust of a city noted for its <lb/>magnificent distances, we yet have our <choice><orig>plea-<lb/>sures</orig><reg>pleasures</reg></choice>.  We certainly had a rich and rare treat <lb/>the other evening.  The Contraband Relief <lb/>Association had a meeting last Tuesday <choice><orig>even-<lb/>ing</orig><reg>evening</reg></choice>, for the purpose of having an election of <lb/>officers for the ensuing year.  Having learned <lb/>that Mr. Frederick Douglass was in the city, <lb/>and intended to be present on that occasion, <lb/>of course I made for the place, the 15th Street <lb/>Presbyterian Church.</p>
            
           <p>As soon as I entered the room I found a <lb/>great many of the members present, also many <lb/>spectators.  The President, Mrs. Keckley, <lb/>called the house to order, and commenced the <lb/>preliminaries.  Just as they were reading a <lb/>portion of Scripture, which is the custom of <lb/>the Society when they open their meetings, a <lb/>gentleman entered the room, and there was <lb/>such an <choice><orig>outbust</orig><reg>ourburst</reg></choice> of applause that it brought <lb/>me to my feet to see what was the matter. <lb/>Never having seen Mr. Douglass, I was not <lb/>sure it was him until I heard a whisper, "That's <lb/>Frederick Douglass."  I then felt assured that <lb/>my eyes beheld a man whom I had never seen <lb/>before, but had long desired to see.  The house <lb/>by this time had become crowded.</p>
            
            <p>Mr. <choice><abbr>Wm.</abbr><expan>William</expan></choice> Slade was called upon to introduce <lb/>Mr. Douglass, which he did in his usual <lb/>affable manner.  Loud calls were then made <lb/>for "Douglass."  He arose, and with the eye <lb/>of an eagle, scanned the whole crowd, and <lb/>said that he thanked the Society and audience <lb/>with all the gratitude that his poor heart <lb/>could possess for the attention and honor they <lb/>had conferred upon him; and, as they had met <lb/>for a specific purpose, he would be happy, truly <lb/>happy, after they had gotten through with <lb/>their election, to make a few remarks.  The <lb/>proposition of Mr. D. being acceded to, they <lb/>proceeded with the election ; upon the <choice><orig>conclu-<lb/>sion</orig><reg>conclusion</reg></choice> of which Mr. D. arose and spoke for about <lb/>half an hour.  I must say that I never was so <lb/>interested in all my life as I was on this <lb/>occasion.  He riveted the attention of the <lb/>audience to such a degree, that at times you <lb/>could have heard a pin fall.  After Mr. D. had <lb/>finished his remarks, I had the extreme <choice><orig>plea-<lb/>sure</orig><reg>pleasure</reg></choice> of an introduction.</p>
            
            <p>The flag gotten up by the ladies of the <choice><orig>Con-<lb/>traband</orig><reg>Contraband</reg></choice> Relief Association for the First District <lb/>Colored Volunteers being in the room, it <lb/>was examied very closely by Mr. D., who <lb/>expressed his great delight of the design and <lb/>workmanship of the artist (Mr. Bowser of <lb/>Philadelphia), and after shaking hands with <lb/>many, he retired.  I should not forget to <choice><orig>men-<lb/>tion</orig><reg>mention</reg></choice> an instance of Mr. D.'s liberality.  He was <lb/>so pleased with the object of the Society, that <lb/>he requested them to call or draw upon him <lb/>for fifty dollars, which he said he gave <choice><orig>cheer-<lb/>fully</orig><reg>cheerfully</reg></choice> to aid them in their great work of <choice><orig>bene-<lb/>volence</orig><reg>benevolence</reg></choice>.</p>
            
            <p>The Society then passed a resolution to set <lb/>apart the following Thursday evening for their <lb/>Anniversary, they having been in existence <lb/>one year from last August, also for presentation <lb/>of the flag.  The Regiment had left but a <lb/>detachment to receive the flag.  On the arrival <lb/>of said evening, Mr. George Cook presented <lb/>the flag in a few very appropriate remarks, <lb/>and it was received on behalf of the Regiment <lb/>by Capt. Ferroe, of the Contraband Barracks, <lb/>whose command the detachment was under.</p>
            
            <p>I noticed present on the occasion Rev. J. N. <lb/>Gloucester and Prof. <choice><abbr>Wm.</abbr><expan>William</expan></choice> J. Wilson of <choice><orig>Brook-<lb/>lyn</orig><reg>Brooklyn</reg></choice>, both of whom made very suitable <choice><orig>ad-<lb/>dresses</orig><reg>addresses</reg></choice>, as did also Col. John W. Forney of <lb/><title level="j" rend="italic">The Daily Chronicle</title>.</p>
            
            <p>Since writing the above, I am informed that <lb/>Frederick Douglass has received a commission <lb/>from the War Department, to go down South, <lb/>in company with Adj. Gen. Thomas, to aid that <lb/>distinguished officer in the organization of <lb/>colored troops.  I hope it is a fact.  If it is <lb/>so, how strange these things are!  Frederick <lb/>Douglass, but a few years ago a terror to the <lb/>South, now on a mission of that kind.  There <lb/>is no question about it, <lb/><floatingText>
