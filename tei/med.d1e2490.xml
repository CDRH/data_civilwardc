                                        Diagnosis&#8212;typhoid fever. He was taken sick about
                                        <date type="injury" when="1861-10-22">the 22d</date> with diarrh&#339;a, chills, weakness and loss of
                                        appetite. On admission his face was flushed, pulse 100 and
                                        of fair strength, skin hot and dry, tongue thickly coated,
                                        teeth black with sordes, breath very offensive; he had much
                                        thirst, relaxed bowels and some tenderness in the right
                                        iliac region, with borborygmus and tympanites; he muttered
                                        in his sleep. Oil of turpentine, compound catechu powders
                                        and whiskey-punch were prescribed. Delirium became a
                                        prominent symptom for a few days, during which the pulse was
                                        strong and slightly above 100, the face dusky, the eyes much
                                        injected and the tongue red at the tip, blackened and
                                        fissured; but on Nov. 4 the delirium lessened, the pulse
                                        fell to 86; he slept well during the previous night, the
                                        teeth and gums were cleaner and the skin was soft and
                                        presented a few rose-colored spots. On the 5th the pulse was
                                        88 and feeble; petechial spots appeared on the skin; the
                                        tongue was very dry and thickly coated brown. The patient
                                        was drowsy and difficult to arouse; one stool was passed,
                                        and the bowels were tender and gurgled on pressure. On the
                                        7th the mind became clearer and the eyes were less injected,
                                        but otherwise there was little change in the condition; he
                                        complained of pain in the feet. The record gives no further
                                        details. He was transferred to <name type="place">Baltimore, Md.</name>, on <date
