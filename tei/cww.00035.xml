                <p>And your petitioner prays the said Commissioners to investigate and determine the

                    of said <seg type="handwritten">parties</seg> herein above set forth; and if the

                    claim in money, and report the same to the Secretary of the Treasury of the
                    United States, in conformity to the provisions of said act of Congress.</p>
