        conical ball, which fractured and depressed both tables of the frontal bone just below the
        fronto-parietal suture and to the left of the median line. He was <date type="admit"
          when="1864-06-20">immediately</date> admitted to the 1st division, Fifth Corps, hospital;
        on <date type="transfer" when="1864-06-24">June 24th</date>, sent to the <name

          type="transfer" when="1864-06-27">the 27th</date>, transferred to the <name
          type="hospital">Satterlee Hospital, Philadelphia</name>. His pulse became slow and feeble,
        and on <date type="operation" when="1864-07-14">July 14th</date>, his condition was very
        low. A disk of bone, one and a half inches in diameter, was removed, exposing the meninges
        of the brain. Pus flowed freely from the opening. The wound subsequently became gangrenous,
        and death ensued on <date type="death" when="1864-07-26">July 26th, 1864</date>. The <hi
          rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> examination revealed an abscess in the left anterior lobe
        of the brain, with pus in the ventricles. The pathological specimen is figured in the
        wood-cut. The opening in the frontal bone is surrounded by a narrow ring of porous and
        diseased bone. The fractured portion of vitreous table measures one and a half by two
        inches. Two fragments remain in situ depressed one line. These fragments are covered by a
        thin, granular, mortar-like layer of calcareous matter. The specimen was contributed by
          <name type="person">Acting Assistant Surgeon G. P. Sargent</name>. </p>
