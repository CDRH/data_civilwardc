                                Cav.</name>; age 42; died suddenly while in camp, <date type="death" when="1863-12-09">Dec. 9, 1863</date>.  He
                                        had not been at surgeon's call during his service of over
                                        ten months in this regiment, but a comrade stated that he
                                        would occasionally place his hand to his side, complain of
                                        pain, and remark that he would die of disease of the heart.
                                        He had previously served five years in the 3d Art'y and five
                                        years in the 2d Inf.  On the day before his death he marched
                                        with his regiment a distance of twenty-five miles. It rained
                                        all day and was very cold, nearly freezing. He, like every
                                        one else, had to sleep on the ground in wet clothes. Next
                                        morning a march of five miles was made and the regiment went
                                        into camp. Fletcher, while assisting to pitch a tent, fell
                                        down and, gasping once or twice, died.  <hi rend="italic">Post-mortem</hi> examination: Neck swollen as though the <choice><sic>bloodvessels</sic><corr>blood vessels</corr></choice> were
                                        engorged. The pericardium was smooth and healthy, but was
                                        enormously distended with twenty-six ounces of blood-clot
                                        and serum. The heart was of natural size, but the walls of
                                        the left ventricle were thicker while those of the right
                                        appeared somewhat thinner than usual; the endocardium and
                                        valves were healthy. In the aorta, about an inch and a half
                                        above the valves, was an aperture a quarter of an inch in
                                        diameter, opening into an <choice><orig>aneurism</orig><reg>aneurysm</reg></choice> the size of an egg, the
                                        walls of which adhered firmly to the superior cava and
                                        pericardium and were as thick as those of the aorta itself
                                        except at a point where rupture had taken place into the
                                        pericardial sac,&#8212;[<hi rend="italic">Specimen</hi> 965, Med. Sec., <name type="hospital" key="431">Army Medical Museum</name>]. The left pleura was adherent and the
                                        lung engorged with venous blood; the right lung was healthy, although much compressed by the liver, which was so
                                        engorged as to reach the lower border of the third rib. The
                                        spleen was enlarged; the kidneys healthy.&#8212;<hi rend="italic"><name type="person">Act. Ass' t Surgeon Thomas Bowen</name>, <name type="organization">4th U. S. Cav.</name></hi> </p>
