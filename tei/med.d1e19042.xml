            <p> <hi rend="initialcap">C</hi>ASE.—<name type="person">Private James McCauley</name>, <name type="organization">Co. C, 1st United States Cavalry</name>, aged 21 years,
                received a sabre thrust of the chest at <name type="BATTLE" key="297">Upperville, Virginia</name>, <date type="injury" when="1863-06-21">June 21st, 1863</date>.
                    The point entered about two inches above and to the inner edge of the inferior
                    angle of the right scapula, passed directly through the upper lobe of the right
                    lung from behind forward, and made its appearance beneath the integument two
                    inches above the right nipple, producing a discoloration at that point. He also
                    received four sabre cuts of the head, one of which, over the right parietal
                    bone, fractured the skull; the others were scalp wounds. He was treated in the
                    field, and, on <date type="admit" when="1863-06-24">the 24th</date>, was sent to <name type="hospital" key="172">Emory Hospital</name>, Washington. On admission,
                    he complained of very slight dyspnœa and some constipation, which was obviated
                    by a potion of castor oil. Pulse 84; tongue clean; appetite good. A bandage
                    was placed around the chest and cold-water dressings applied. A fragment of
                    bone was removed from the right parietal bone. He was furloughed on <date type="furlough" when="1863-07-17">July 17th</date>, and returned to duty
                to <name type="place">Carlisle Barracks</name>, <date type="duty" when="1863-09-11">September 11th, 1863</date>. <name type="person">Pension Examiner J. O. Stanton</name>
                reports, under date of <date type="pension" when="1871-08-03">August 3d, 1871</date>: "The pensioner states that he frequently
                    has hæmorrhage from the lungs. There seems to be considerable irritability of
                    the throat and fauces. He is strong and muscular; circulation good." </p>
