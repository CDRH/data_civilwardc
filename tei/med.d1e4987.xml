                                        typhoid fever. This man had been sick with continued fever
                                        for <date type="injury" when="1861-10-15">six days prior</date> to his admission, during which time he
                                        was treated with diaphoretics and tonics. On the 22d his
                                        pulse was 84, tongue dry and brown, skin hot and dry. Three
                                        five-grain doses of quinine were given with blue-mass and
                                        ipecacuanha. Next day the pulse was 80, the skin cool and
                                        the tongue moist. Four two-grain doses of quinine were given
                                        with Dover's powder at bedtime. There was a
                                        diarrh&#339;a of two or three stools daily from the 24th
                                        to the 28th, and the tongue became dry and brown in the
                                        centre. On the 29th the pulse was 90 and quick, the tongue
                                        dry and tremulous, the skin hot; stupor, much delirium,
                                        frequent dry cough, some uneasiness on inspiration and
                                        crepitation in the lower part of the left side of the chest
                                        were among the symptoms recorded on this day. Calomel,
                                        ipecacuanha and quinine with turpentine emulsion and
                                        chlorate of potash were prescribed, and a blister applied to
                                        the left side. Next day there was cough with bloody sputa;
                                        the patient could be roused from his muttering delirium to
                                        answer questions, but he replied slowly and protruded his
                                        tongue with hesitation; the diarrh&#339;a ceased during
                                        this attack. The cough became less frequent and the
                                        expectoration viscid and rusty on November 1. Wine was
                                        ordered four times daily. During the following night a
                                        profuse epistaxis occurred. The tongue became moist on the
                                        3d and next day the expectoration was more abundant and the
                                        drowsiness lessened; pulse 76; respiration 24. A blister was
                                        applied to the front of the chest. On the 7th the cough was
                                        lessened, the expectoration mucous, the countenance bright,
                                        the bowels regular. Milk diet was ordered with an ounce of brandy every four hours. He
