                        type="injury" when="1864-06-03">June 3d, 1864</date>, by a conoidal musket
                    ball, which struck about two inches to the left of the median line and anterior
                    to the coronal suture, passed backward along the sagittal suture, fracturing the
                    external table of the left parietal bone, and emerged about two inches from the
                    point of entrance.  He was admitted to the hospital of the 3d division, Sixth
                        Corps; on <date type="transfer" when="1864-06-07">June 7th</date>, was sent to

                    right arm was nearly useless.  He was discharged on <date type="servicedischarge"
