     Woodruff</name>, <name type="organization" key="492">Co. A, 10th Vermont</name>, aged 19 years,
    was wounded through the right leg, at <name type="BATTLE" key="263">Cold Harbor</name>, <date

     <name type="person" key="1245">Surgeon H. Janes</name>, <name type="organization" key="132">U.
     S. V.</name>, contributed the photograph (<hi rend="initialcap">F</hi>IG. 266), with the
    following history: "The wound was caused by a musket ball, which entered about the middle of the
    leg, on the outer and posterior aspect, passed forward and emerged anteriorly between the tibia
    and fibula, two inches below the point of entrance, fracturing the fibula. Several pieces of
    bone were removed at the time of the injury. Gangrene followed, and the wound opened to the size
    of an open hand. The wound of entrance closed in April, 1865, but that of exit had not healed at
    the time of his discharge from service. He was then obliged to use a crutch in walking. The
    patient also had a congenital malposition of the heart, which he never discovered until the time
    of his enlistment, the location of it being on the right side, with the apex beating under the
    right nipple. His chest was well formed, and he was a stout and, excepting his wound, a healthy
    man." The patient was discharged from service <date type="servicedischarge" when="1865-08-18"
     >August 18, 1865</date>, and pensioned. <name type="person" key="xx">Examiner G. B.
     Bullard</name>, of <name type="place" key="xx">St. Johnsbury, Vermont</name>, certified, on
     <date type="pension" when="1866-01-25">January 25, 1866</date>, that particles of bone were
    still being discharged from the wound, and the pensioner complained of stiffness of the ankle
    joint, and that he was unable to bear his weight on his right foot or walk without crutches. He
    was last paid <date type="pension" when="1866-09-04">September 4, 1866</date>, since when he has
    not been heard from. </p>
