                                        Diagnosis—typhoid fever. The patient was weak,
                                        dull and stupid; pulse 104, skin hot and dry, tongue dry,
                                        brown and heavily coated, bowels relaxed and painful.
                                        Whiskey and beef-essence were administered. Six thin stools
                                        were passed during the next twenty-four hours; the right
                                        iliac region was tender. Turpentine emulsion, Hoffmann's
                                        anodyne and morphine were prescribed. On the 9th delirium,
                                        epistaxis, rose-colored spots and three thin dark stools
                                        were noted, and on the 10th sordes, subsultus, difficulty in
                                        protruding the tongue and aggravation of the
                                        diarrhœa. Enemata of starch and laudanum were used,
                                        but the diarrhœa persisted, giving five or six
                                        stools daily until the end. A profuse eruption of
                                        rose-colored spots and sudamina appeared on the 14th. The
                                        stools were passed involuntarily on the 16th, and afterwards
                                        the abdomen was tympanitic and tender in the right iliac
                                        region. Carbonate of ammonia was prescribed on the 17th.
                                        Next day the stomach was irritable, the respiration labored,
                                        skin congested, eyes dull, half opened and with contracted
                                        pupils. On the 19th a few rose-colored spots appeared; the
                                        pulse was 120, soft and compressible, and the features
                                        shrunken. Death took place on <date type="death" when="1861-09-20">the 20th</date>. </p>
