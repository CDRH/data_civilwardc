                                        Diagnosis&#8212;typhoid fever. He was weak and feverish,
                                        and had diarrh&#339;a, tympanites and well-marked
                                        rose-spots; pulse 110; tongue dry and brown but red at the
                                        tip; teeth covered with sordes. Brandy-punch, beef-essence
                                        and astringents were given. Next day he was slightly
                                        incoherent, and on September 4 delirious. The record does
                                        not again state his condition until the 13th, when there was
                                        fever with much thirst, delirium, tinnitus aurium, musc&#230;
                                        volitantes, a moist brown tongue and dry hot skin. Dover's
                                        powder, beef-essence and brandy were given at this time. On
                                        the 15th, the patient's general condition remaining the
                                        same, his pulse rose to 106, his tongue became dry, and in
                                        the evening his urine was passed involuntarily. On the 16th
                                        the presence of bronchitis was reported. Next day his tongue
                                        began to clean in patches, and on the 18th was moist, glossy
                                        and nearly smooth, the appetite improved and the bowels
                                        quiet; but the delirium did not abate until the following
                                        day, when in the evening it recurred, accompanied with
                                        abdominal tenderness and tympanites, some cough, hurried
                                        respiration, 30, and dryness of the tongue, which was
                                        protruded with difficulty. On the 21st he rested well; his
                                        face was pale and sunken but bright; his tongue remained
                                        dry, red and glossy, and was slightly coated in patches; the
                                        teeth were covered with sordes; the cough continued; but the
                                        hearing was good, the bowels quiet, the urine normal and the
                                        appetite good. Next day delirium was again added to these
                                        symptoms,and on the 23d some deafness and subsultus
                                        tendinum. On this day the tongue again became moist, but
                                        dried on the 24th in the centre although remaining red and
                                        moist at the edges. Turpentine emulsion was ordered. This
                                        condition continued until the 26th, when the delirium became
                                        lessened, the face and lips pale, the expression anxious,
                                        the eyes clear and bright, the pulse 96, the skin dry and
                                        husky but of natural temperature, and the tongue clean, soft
                                        and moist, but with some sordes remaining on the teeth. Some
                                        perspiration is mentioned on the 27th as occurring on the
                                        skin for the first time in the history of the case. Delirium
                                        recurred on the 29th, with slight failure of the appetite
                                        and cough, the tongue remaining moist and the bowels
                                        undisturbed. After this the skin was natural, moist, or
                                        occasionally dry, the tongue clean or slightly patched with
                                        yellow, the pulse from 72 to 96, the appetite good; but the
                                        bowels became relaxed, yielding two, three or four stools
                                        daily. While in this condition he was transferred to
