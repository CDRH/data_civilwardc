H, 21st New Jersey</name>, aged 25 years, was wounded in abdomen at <name type="BATTLE" key="10">Chancellorsville</name>, <date type="injury" when="1863-05-03">May 3, 1863</date>.

L. M. Burritt</name>, who had charge of the case, states that the "patient was shot through the sacrum, which was much comminuted; the ball came out about an inch above the pubes. F&#230;ces escaped freely externally; no natural action of the bowels took place. Two grains of morphia were given daily and extra diet ordered. The patient was failing when he was admitted, but lingered <date type="death" when="1863-05">a few days</date>, and gradually sank, with symptoms of peritonitis.   A <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> examination was made six hours after death: The bullet entered at the left ala of the sacrum and emerged in the hypogastric region, one inch above the pubes. The peritoneum was deeply injected, and the peritoneal sac contained a dark greenish and sanguinous mixture; and serous effusion. A fold of the small intestine was twice perforated by the ball, but the bladder was uninjured. Gas and f&#230;ces passed from behind into the gluteal muscles."</p>
