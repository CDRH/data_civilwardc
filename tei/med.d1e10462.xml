                                                R. Corps</name>; age 25; a member of the hospital
                                        guard, was admitted from quarters on the evening of <date type="admit" when="1864-08-14">August 14,
                                                1864</date>. He had complained of debility and loss
                                        of appetite for several days, and the orderly sergeant
                                        thought him slightly out of his head.  On admission he was
                                        weak, feverish, thirsty and sick at stomach, but did not
                                        vomit; pulse 90; he had headache but no other pain. Neutral
                                        mixture and aconite were prescribed. He was restless and
                                        slept but little during the night, and next morning he did
                                        not seem to realize where he was. He wanted to get up and
                                        steal away, but was quiet withal. His head was hot, eyes
                                        somewhat injected, tongue furred, pulse 95 and stronger. The
                                        ice-bag, a brisk purgative and acetate of ammonia with
                                        antimonial wine and nitric ether were prescribed. Morphia
                                        was administered in the evening and he passed a better
                                        night.  On <date type="death" when="1864-08-16">the 16th</date> he was mildly delirious, sinking into
                                        stupor when left undisturbed; pupils somewhat dilated,
                                        symmetrical; eyes more injected; pulse 80 and full;
                                        respiration deep and regular but slower than natural. He had
                                        no spasm of any kind. A blister was applied to the nape of
                                        the neck and sinapisms to the epigastrium and inside of the
                                        thighs; quinine was given in full doses. His bowels had been
                                        freely moved.  No improvement followed,—the stupor
                                        grew more profound, and he died comatose about 11 P. M., a
                                        little over forty-eight hours after his
                                                admission.—<hi rend="italic"><name type="hospital" key="175">Stanton Hospital</name>,
