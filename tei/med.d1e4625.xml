                                        fever. On March 5 he was delirious, drowsy and inclined to
                                        stupor; he had tinnitus aurium and twitching of the mouth,

                                        watery stools daily, which were sometimes passed
                                        involuntarily; respiration was hurried and there was some
                                        cough. Beef-essence, turpentine emulsion and tincture of
                                        opium were prescribed. On the 6th there was profuse
                                        perspiration with sudamina. Next day the delirium abated and
                                        the patient replied rationally but with difficulty; the
                                        tongue was coated but moist, and was permitted to remain
                                        protruded indefinitely; the bowels were regular but
                                        meteorized and tender and the abdomen showed some
                                        rose-colored spots; the breath was very offensive from
                                        oz&#230;na. There was much tendency to stupor on the
                                        9th, with occasional delirium. Free perspiration with
                                        sudamina occurred again on the 10th, and the urine was
                                        excessive in quantity; cough persisted and there was some

                                        right side. The skin became hot and dry on the 12th and the
                                        watery stools returned; respiration was hurried and the
                                        breath very offensive. The mind became clear on the 14th,
                                        and on the following day the skin was natural, the tongue
                                        clean, the pulse good, but the bowels continued loose. The
                                        diarrh&#339;a, however, subsided on the 16th, on the
                                        occurrence of copious sweating with sudamina, and the congh
                                        was much relieved; earache, developed on this day, was noted
                                        also on the 17th, when the skin again became hot and dry and
                                        the tongue somewhat coated. Some sore spots on the back and
                                        hips were observed on the 18th, and next day the patient was
                                        placed on a water-bed. He became deaf at this time, but his
                                        general condition improved, and on the 28th he was able to
                                        walk about. He was discharged <date type="servicedischarge"
