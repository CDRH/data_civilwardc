                <p>That your petitioners claim to the service or labor of said <persName>Dudly
                        Nelson</persName> was at the time of said discharge therefrom of the value
                    of fifteen hundred dollars in money.</p>
                <p>Said <persName>Dudly Nelson</persName> is a valuable house servant, is
                    industrious, active, honest &#38; to your petitioner invaluable He has no

                <p>Your petitioner hereby declares that he bears true and faithful allegiance to the
                    Government of the <placeName>United States</placeName> and that he has not
                    borne arms against the <placeName>United States</placeName> in the present
                    rebellion nor in any way given aid or comfort thereto.</p>

                <p>And your petitioner further states and alleges that he has not brought said
                        <persName>Dudly Nelson</persName> into the <placeName>District of

                    valid, that they appraise and apportion the value of said claim in money &#38;
