The brain was healthy; it weighed forty-six ounces, and contained little or no fluid. The trachea contained a few masses of tenacious mucus; its mucous membrane was purplish. The right lung weighed nineteen ounces; its upper lobe was much congested; the middle lobe was bound to the thoracic parietes by old adhesions; the left lung weighed thirteen ounces and a half; both lobes were engorged with blood. The heart weighed eight ounces and a half; the right auricle was empty; its lining membrane was dark-red; the right ventricle contained a quantity of venous blood, and a thin fibrinous clot which extended into the pulmonary artery; the left auricle contained a small firm fibrinous clot. The liver was healthy; the gall-bladder was full of yellowish turbid bile. The spleen was firm, and weighed four ounces and a half. The pancreas was pale and firm; it weighed three ounces. The right kidney weighed five ounces; its cortical substance was of an ash-red color and rather flabby; the left kidney weighed four ounces and a half; its cortical substance was of a dark-purple color and firm. The &#339;sophagus, stomach, and small intestine presented nothing abnormal. The mucous membrane of the c&#230;cum and ascending colon was of a dark-green color, and presented a number of large ulcers with ragged excavated borders; in the transverse and descending colon, as far as the sigmoid flexure, the mucous membrane was thickened and covered in many places with a characteristic exudation.&#8212;<name type="person" key="245">Assistant Surgeon Harrison Allen</name>, <name type="organization" key="190">U.
