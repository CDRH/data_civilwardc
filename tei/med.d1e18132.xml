                                                  entered above and a little forward of the
                                                  posterior fold of the left axilla, passed inward,
                                                  upward, and forward, and emerged just above the
                                                  convexity of the left clavicle, which it
                                                  shattered, again entered an inch nearer the neck,
                                                  preserving nearly its original direction, finally
                                                  emerging through the right cheek, breaking a few
                                                  small pieces from the middle of the lower edge of

                                                  discharge, particularly from the first wound of
                                                  exit. About <date type="injury" when="1862-12-30">December 30th</date>, his mind became
                                                  somewhat affected, and there was great and
                                                  increasing tendency to sleep. On the night of
                                                  January 12th, 1863, he was attacked with violent
                                                  pain in the left hypochondrium, which was partly
                                                  relieved by the application of sinapisms. On
                                                                <date type="operation" when="1863-01-13">January 13th</date>, two fragments of bone were removed
                                                  with the forceps from the acromial portions of the
                                                  clavicle from which they had become partially
                                                  detached. On <date type="death" when="1863-01-14">January 14th</date>, he went to sleep after
                                                  eating heartily; his breathing was shorter than
                                                  usual. Upon being spoken to he opened his eyes,
                                                  but closed them again; his breathing became still
                                                  shorter, and with longer intervals, for about five
                                                  minutes, when he died, perfectly quiet, and
                                                  apparently without pain. At the autopsy, the head
                                                  of the humerus was found destroyed, and the shaft
                                                  fractured for three inches below it. The glenoid
                                                  cavity and neck of the scapula were destroyed as
                                                  far back as the supra-scapular notch; a partial
                                                  fracture extended across the infra-spinous fossa.
                                                  The front of the thyroid cartilage had been
                                                  carried away. A notch was cut out of the under
                                                  surface of the inferior maxilla, right side. The
                                                  left lung was compressed by an abundant pleuritic
                                                  effusion, and contained a single abscess. The
                                                  parenchyma of the left lung was not examined.
                                                  There was not any opening into the pleura. A drop
                                                  of blood taken from the axillary vein exhibited
                                                  nearly as many white as red corpuscles. The
                                                  specimen, consisting of the left clavicle,
                                                  scapula, and upper third of the humerus, is
                                                  numbered 695 of the Surgical Section of the <name type="hospital" key="431">Army Medical Museum</name>, and was contributed, with a
                                                                history of the case, by <name type="person">Medical Cadet Burt G. Wilder</name>, <name type="organization" key="190">U. S. A.</name> The ball entered the posterior aspect of
                                                  the shoulder-joint, and emerged at the centre of
                                                  the clavicle, causing extensive comminution of the
                                                  glenoid cavity and head of the humerus. The
                                                  clavicle is fractured obliquely. A fissure extends
                                                  transversely through the body of the scapula below
                                                  the spine. The acromion and coracoid processes are
                                                  detached. The shaft of the humerus exhibits
                                                  several fissures. The fractured extremities of the
                                                  clavicle are necrosed. The specimen shows but
                                                  little attempt at repair. </p>
