There was great discoloration, resembling ecchymosis, over the thorax and abdomen. The greater omentum and a large part of the mesentery were much injected. The mucous membrane of the jejunum and ileum was softened; in the ileum it was much injected. The mucous membrane of the colon was greatly injected and very much disorganized.</p> 
   <p>⃰ It is to be regretted that, in most instances, the records of this hospital do not show by whom the autopsies were made. It is known that many of them were made by <name type="person" key="134">Surgeon Bentley</name> himself, or under his immediate supervision, but it is only possible to distinguish these from the others in a few cases.</p>
