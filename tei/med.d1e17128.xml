                                                  with a gunshot wound of the head. The missile, a
                                                  musket-ball, entered one-fourth of an inch above
                                                  the middle of the right supra-orbital arch,
                                                  fractured the outer table of the frontal bone, and
                                                  taking a semicircular course, lodged above the
                                                  right ear, whence it was extracted. The left upper
                                                  eyelid was very much swollen, completely closing
                                                  the eye; and there were symptoms of fever, with
                                                  considerable pain. Cold-water dressings were
                                                  applied, and the swelling gradually subsided. On
                                                                <date type="operation" when="1863-05-20">May 20th</date>, an incision was made, and a quantity of
                                                  pus evacuated, which relieved the parts and
                                                  improved the condition of the patient. On June 2d
                                                  a piece of bone came away, and on <date type="injury" when="1863-06-12">June 12th</date>
                                                  erysipelas attacked the orbital region. The wound
                                                  was laid freely open down to the frontal bone,
                                                  which was found to be denuded of periosteum. On
                                                  June 23d, the erysipelas extended all over the
                                                  face, forehead, and right side of scalp; the
                                                  tongue was furred, bowels loose, and appetite
                                                  poor. Through the wound protruded a large tumor,
                                                  the size of an orange, caused by thickening of the
                                                  periosteum. A solution of sulphate of iron was
                                                  applied to the infected parts. The symptoms being
                                                  of a typhoid character, the patient was treated
                                                  with fresh breeze day and night, beef tea, brandy,
                                                  and flax-seed enema. On July 1st, the tongue had
                                                  become moist and the stools more natural. On <date type="operation" when="1863-07-06">July 6th</date>, the tumor was dissected, and isinglass
                                                  plaster applied. The edges of the wound were then
                                                  gradually approximated, and a steady improvement
                                                  followed. He was sent to the <name type="organization">provost marshal</name> on
