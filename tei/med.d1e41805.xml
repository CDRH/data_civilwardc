Inguinal hernia.  When first seen by the reporter, September 9th, he was suffering from distressing dyspepsia, for which he was treated with gentian, quinia and other tonics, bismuth, stimulants, &#38;c.  Vomiting occurred constantly shortly after eating, even when the lightest diet was employed; nevertheless, his appetite seemed good. The pain after eating was so severe at times as to require anodynes. He had also occasional attacks of diarrh&#339;a, lasting about a day, and ceasing spontaneously without the use of remedies. Between these attacks he was sometimes constipated, so as to require laxatives. At one time the abdominal pain was so severe that a blister was applied, with temporary relief. He finally refused medicine, and for more than a month took none except occasional anodynes when the pain was severe.  December 5th: He was attacked with severe diarrh&#339;a, the stools being cream-colored and yeasty in appearance. He failed rapidly, and died <date type="death" when="1864-12-07">December 7th</date>.  <hi rend="italic">Autopsy</hi> <date type="autopsy" when="1864-12-08">eighteen hours after death</date>: Body much emaciated.
