                <salute>Mr. Editor:â€”</salute>
            </opener>
            
            <p>Since the publication of my last <lb/>letter I have been somewhat amused at a vast <lb/>number of the readers of the <title level="j" rend="italic">Anglo-African</title>. <lb/>The great whisperings and the oft-repeated <lb/>question, "who is Bob Logic?" has fallen upon <lb/>my ear so frequently, that I know and feel the <lb/>great estimation they have of our mutual friend, <lb/>your regular correspondent "Box."  How can it <lb/>be otherwise?  A man like "Box," possessing so <lb/>many good qualities; affable, kind and, what is <lb/>better, being a genius, his company is enjoyed <lb/>by all that know him.  "Box" is the parlor as <lb/>well as the table-talk.  Indeed, so frequently <lb/>do I hear the word "Box," that it reminds me of <lb/>an anecdote of a Frenchman's first visit to <lb/>America, and as there has been much good <choice><orig>de-<lb/>rived</orig><reg>derived</reg></choice> from the most excellent letters of "Box," <lb/>I will relate it.</p>
            
            <p>A Frenchman came to this country at a <lb/>time when there were no railroads, and <choice><orig>passen-<lb/>gers</orig><reg>passengers</reg></choice> had to be conveyed from place to place in <lb/>a diligence or stage-coach and not having seen <lb/>the great city of New-York, applied at the <choice><orig>stage-<lb/>office</orig><reg>stage-office</reg></choice> for a seat.  He was informed that the stage <lb/>was full, but the agent told him that if he was <lb/>anxious to go, he could give him a box seat. <lb/><foreign><hi rend="italic">"Mon dieu! mon dieu!"</hi></foreign> exclaimed the <choice><orig>French-<lb/>man</orig><reg>Frenchman</reg></choice>, "you put me in one box to send me to de <lb/>city?"  "O, no Sir!" replied the agent, "I mean <lb/>a seat by the driver."  A box seat having been <lb/>properly explained, the Frenchman pronounced <lb/>it good, and took his seat.  The weather being <lb/>cold and the Frenchman having no overcoat, <choice><orig>suf-<lb/>fered</orig><reg>suffered</reg></choice> much on his journey to the great city. <lb/>Having arrived safely in the city, he <choice><orig>stept</orig><reg>stepped</reg></choice> into <lb/>a merchant tailor's to purchase an overcoat. <lb/>"Ah, <foreign><hi rend="italic">monsieur</hi></foreign>," exclaimed the Frenchman, "I <lb/>vant to get one varm overcoat."  "Yes," replied <lb/>the tailor, "I know what you wantâ€”you want a <lb/>box coat."  The Frenchman stood amazed and <lb/>exclaimed, "Vy vat you mean by box coat, a <lb/>seat side ob de driver<choice><sic>?</sic><corr>?"</corr></choice>  A box coat having been <lb/>explained by the tailor to the satisfaction of the <lb/>Frenchman, he pronounced it good and made <lb/>the purchase, and said, "Vile de vord box <choice><orig>per-<lb/>plexy</orig><reg>perplexy</reg></choice> me, he alvays turn out good."  Being now <lb/>hungry, he started for a restaurant to get some <lb/>oysters.  Having entered one, he called on the <lb/>proprietor for a plate of stewed oysters.  The <lb/>bell was rung, the servant came, and ordered <lb/>to get "No. 9 box ready for one."  The <choice><orig>French-<lb/>man</orig><reg>Frenchman</reg></choice> started as if he had been shocked by a <choice><orig>gal-<lb/>vanic</orig><reg>galvanic</reg></choice> battery: <foreign><hi rend="italic">"Mon dieu, mon dieu</hi></foreign>! you put <lb/>me in nine box to eat de oyster?  Me vant one <lb/>pedestal, one table.  I no eat de oyster in 9 <lb/>box<choice><unclear reason="illegible" cert="medium" resp="#el">.</unclear></choice>"  The proprietor became alarmed at the <lb/>sudden violent ebullition of feeling on the part <lb/>of the Frenchman, and it was some time before <lb/>either gained their equilibrium of calmness. <lb/>"No. 9 box" having been explained, the <choice><orig>French-<lb/>man</orig><reg>Frenchman</reg></choice> enjoyed his oysters, and came to the <choice><orig>con-<lb/>clusion</orig><reg>conclusion</reg></choice> that much good cometh out of box. <lb/>Having paid his bill and bidding adieu to the <lb/>proprietor, he hurried to the street, to find some <lb/>place of amusement.  After wending his way <lb/>for a while, he came to the theater.  Coming up <lb/>to the ticket-office, he applied for a ticket.  "You <lb/>want a box-ticket?" inquired the man in the <choice><orig>of-<lb/>fice</orig><reg>office</reg></choice>.  <foreign><hi rend="italic">"Oui, monsieur</hi></foreign>.  You call everything <lb/>by box in America and he turn out good."  His <lb/>ticket being purchased, he was ushered in the <lb/>box; but had not been sitting there long, when <lb/>a lady, who was sitting close by, said "Sir, will <lb/>you take a pinch of snuff out of my box?" <lb/>"Ah, madame, madame," exclaimed the <choice><orig>French-<lb/>man</orig><reg>Frenchman</reg></choice>, "you are so very kind.  Dis word 'box' <lb/>sticketh closer to me than a brother, and for de <lb/>future its name will be sweet music to my ear." </p>
            
            <p>So, Mr. Editor, I hope we will continue to see <lb/>in your most excellent paper, letters from Box, <lb/>as your readers derived much good information <lb/>from them.</p>
            
            <p>The ladies (God bless them!) of the <choice><orig>Contra-<lb/>band</orig><reg>Contraband</reg></choice> Relief Association held a festival at the <lb/>15th st. Presbyterian church, for the purpose of <lb/>raising funds to purchase a flag to be presented <lb/>to the First District Regiment of Colored <choice><orig>Volun-<lb/>teers</orig><reg>Volunteers</reg></choice>.  Mrs. Bond, one of the members of the <lb/>association, was the superintendent of the <choice><orig>festi-<lb/>val</orig><reg>festival</reg></choice>.  She discharged her duties faithfully and <lb/>deserves great credit for the good order and <choice><orig>sys-<lb/>tem</orig><reg>system</reg></choice> in its management.  What would we men <lb/>be without woman?  Look at her in the attitude <lb/>of perseverance, in the attitude of love, you will <lb/>find her engaged in every good word and work. <lb/>Who can describe woman's love?  Would that <lb/>I had the talents of a Byron, Bulwer, or Scott, <lb/>that I might depict woman's love.  She is <choice><orig>fore-<lb/>most</orig><reg>foremost</reg></choice> in every mission of love and mercy.  She <lb/>was first at the cross and last at the sepulcher. <lb/>I cannot refrain from noticing the love and <choice><orig>ener-<lb/>gy</orig><reg>energy</reg></choice> of a young lady engaged in this cause by <lb/>the name of Miss Jane Hall, of Georgetown, D. <lb/>C.  She was called upon to solicit something <choice><orig>to-<lb/>wards</orig><reg>towards</reg></choice> the flag, and in a very few days collected <lb/>twenty-seven dollars and some cents.  There is <lb/>love and energy beyond description.</p>
            
            <p>I see by the list of emigrants that sailed in the <lb/>last packet for Liberia, the name of our <choice><orig>fellow-<lb/>townsman</orig><reg>fellow-townsman</reg></choice>, Mr. John Browne.  He has gone <lb/>thither to select a location for his family who, I <lb/>am informed, will go in the Spring.  In regard <lb/>to emigration, I have always been opposed to <lb/>our people emigrating beyond the United States; <lb/>for I am of the opinion that God intended the <lb/>Southern States for them.  Four millions of <lb/>them have watered that soil with their tears and <lb/>with their blood from the lash of the slaveholder. <lb/>Every day develops, to my mind, the speedy <lb/>consummation of that event, and whilst this is <lb/>the cardinal reason of my opposition to <choice><orig>emigra-<lb/>tion</orig><reg>emigration</reg></choice>, yet at the same time, there are many, very <lb/>many other reasons I could give, but time and <lb/>paper would fail me.</p>
            
            <p>The accursed Fugitive Slave Law, looked <lb/>upon by some as a sacred law, is executed in <lb/>this District without shame or blush.  I thought <lb/>to have been able to give you and your readers <lb/>a detailed account of the trial of the fugitive <lb/>slave Hall, in this letter, but I will defer it until <lb/>I write again.  The two lawyers who defended <lb/>Hall, after the trial was over were arrested for <lb/>obstructing the execution of this sacred law, and <lb/>held to bail in the sum of one thousand dollars <lb/>each.  Our noble friend, Mr. Walker Lewis, <lb/>with all the generosity his noble heart possesses, <lb/>stepped forward and went Mr. Dean's bail; and <lb/>the Hon. John C. Underwood went Mr. Jolliffe's.</p>
            
            <p>Since I wrote you last, the 1st Colored <choice><orig>Regi-<lb/>ment</orig><reg>Regiment</reg></choice> has two more companies added, making <lb/>now five.  They paraded down Pennsylvania <lb/>avenue the other day, making a handsome <choice><orig>dis-<lb/>play</orig><reg>display</reg></choice>.  I was standing by an old officer of the <lb/>army, and he told me they marched as good as <lb/>old veterans.  I long to see the regiment full, <lb/>for I am of the opinion that the 2nd regiment <lb/>will be raised in much less time than the 1st. <lb/>I stated in my last letter that there was some <lb/>misunderstanding with Col. Turner and the <lb/>War Department; that is a fact not to be denied. <lb/>So far from Turner being the colonel of the <choice><orig>re-<lb/>giment</orig><reg>regiment</reg></choice>, he has only been offered a second <choice><orig>lieu-<lb/>tenancy</orig><reg>lieutenancy</reg></choice>.  I am sorry for this, as Turner worked <lb/>hard to get the regiment up.  All the officers <lb/>named in the beginning for the 1st regimentâ€” <lb/>Colonel, Lieutenant-Colonel, Major, Adjutant, <lb/>and Quartermasterâ€”will all be left out in the <lb/>cold.  <choice><abbr>Wm.</abbr><expan>William</expan></choice> Slade, our fellow-townsman, looked <lb/>with much anxiety for the appointment of <choice><orig>quar-<lb/>termaster</orig><reg>quartermaster</reg></choice>, but his fate is that of the others.  But <lb/>there is one consolation these disappointed men <lb/>have: they know they are the choice of the <choice><orig>reg-<lb/>iment</orig><reg>regiment</reg></choice>.  However, "the race is not to the swift <lb/>nor the battle to the strong"â€”they will try their <lb/>hand on the second regiment.</p>
            
            <p>The spirit of recruiting is on the march, as <lb/>you will see from the following proceedings of <lb/>a meeting of colored citizens, held in the 19th <lb/>st. Baptist church on last Friday evening, for <lb/>the purpose of raising a recruiting fund to aid <lb/>in filling up the ranks of the 3rd* Regiment of <lb/>D.C. Vols.  The meeting was called to order by <lb/>Mr. C. Clarke: Mr. Carter A. Steward was chosen <lb/>as chairman, Mr. <choice><abbr>Wm.</abbr><expan>William</expan></choice> H. Wormley as secretary. <lb/>A resolution then passedâ€”"That a fund be <choice><orig>rais-<lb/>ed</orig><reg>raised</reg></choice> to pay any person one dollar a head for every <lb/>recruit they may get to enlist."  The list was <lb/>then opened and the amount of $87 taken up; <lb/>and the following committees appointed to carry <lb/>out the objects of the same:</p>
            
            <p>Mr. C, Clark, chairman; Messrs.  Daniel G. <lb/>Muse, John F. Cook, <choice><abbr>Wm.</abbr><expan>William</expan></choice> H. Wormley, Henry <lb/>Jarvis, A. W. Winkfield, C. A. Stewart, <choice><orig>treas-<lb/>urer</orig><reg>treasurer</reg></choice>.</p>
