                                        1861</date>, having been suffering for some time from
                                        weakness, pain in the bones, heat of skin, thirst and
                                        diarrh&#339;a. On admission his stomach was irritable.
                                        He rested well during the night, and next day, although he
                                        had a brown and thickly coated tongue and a bad taste in his
                                        mouth, his appetite was good, pulse 92 and skin hot and
                                        moist. Dover's powder was given. The tongue became dry and
                                        red at the tip on the 16th; the bowels were moved six times
                                        and were tender; the pulse rose to 108 and there was some
                                        deafness. He muttered continually during sleep on the 17th;
                                        the diarrh&#339;a and irritability of stomach continued.
                                        In the evening rose-colored spots appeared on the chest and
                                        abdomen and sordes on the teeth; the lips were livid, and a
                                        peculiar odor emanated from the body. The muttering during
                                        sleep increased, and on the evening of the 18th the patient
                                        was delirious on awaking; nausea returned and he vomited
                                        twice. During the night he vomited five times a thin
                                        greenish-yellow matter of a highly offensive odor. Mild
                                        delirium continued during the 19th, and the urine was passed
                                        involuntarily; the matter vomited became of a lighter color;
                                        the diarrh&#339;a persisted notwithstanding the
                                        administration of astringents, and there was intestinal
                                        gurgling with umbilical tenderness. Calomel in one-grain
                                        doses was given. Next day the gastric irritability was
                                        quieted and the diarrh&#339;a lessened. In the evening
                                        he was restless and wakeful, his skin hot and dry, but his
                                        face covered with a cold perspiration, pulse 120, weak and
                                        tremulous; he had subsultus tendinum and passed one stool
                                        involuntarily. A similar stool was passed on the 21st,
                                        during which the prostration increased. The right iliac
                                        region is noted as having been tender on this day. He died
                                        on <date type="death" when="1861-09-22">the 22d</date>. </p>
