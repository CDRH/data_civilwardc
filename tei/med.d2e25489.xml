   <p><hi rend="initialcap">C</hi>ASE 997.&#8212;<hi rend="italic">Amputation in the thigh.</hi>&#8212;<name type="person" key="xxx">Private C. W. Barnes</name>, <name type="organization" key="xxx">Co. I, 95th New York</name>, aged 23 years, was admitted to
    <name type="hospital" key="xxx">Mower Hospital, Philadelphia</name>, <date type="transfer" when="1863-05-06">May 6, 1863</date>, suffering from osteo-cephalomatous tumor of the right tibia.  <name type="person" key="xx">Surgeon J. Hopkinson</name>,
    <name type="organization" key="132">U. S. V.</name>, reported:  &#34;The history of this patient's case is as follows: While he was assisting in building a wharf at Aquia Creek, about <date type="injury" when="1862-06-20">June 20, 1862</date>, he fell and bruised himself over the spine of the right tibia. He was soon able to resume duty, but in about <date type="injury" when="1862-06-30">ten days after the accident</date> he noticed a small lump growing on his leg. This gave him no annoyance and he remained with his
    regiment until the battle of <name type="BATTLE" key="127">Bull Run</name>, <date type="injury" when="1862-08-29">August 29, 1862</date>, when he was taken prisoner. He remained in captivity until <date type="transfer" when="1862-12">the following
     December</date>, when he was paroled, sent to <name type="place">Annapolis</name>, and thence back to his command.  He now continued to perform the duties
    of a soldier until <date type="injury" when="1863-02-20">February 20, 1863</date>, when he was again excused on account of the swelling, and <date type="admit" when="1863-03">one month later</date> he was sent to
    <name type="hospital" key="162">Douglas Hospital</name>, whence he was transferred here. The tumor in the <choice><orig>mean time</orig><reg>meantime</reg></choice> had gradually grown
    larger, attaining the size of a goose egg by <date type="operation" when="1863-07-29">July 29th</date>, when it was decided to remove it, which was accordingly done by <name type="person" key="xxx">Assistant Surgeon C. R. Greenleaf</name>, <name type="organization" key="190">U. S. A.</name>  In a few days, however, it began to reappear
    in the wound, and large portions of it were removed on <date type="operation" when="1863-08-20">August 20th</date> by <name type="person" key="xxx">the same operator</name>, after which it
    was not long before it again showed signs of returning, and amputation was decided upon. The limb was
    taken off, after gaining the patient's consent, on <date type="operation" when="1863-10-17">October 17th</date>, at the lower third of the thigh, by <name type="person" key="xxx">Acting
    Assistant Surgeon J. H. Jamar</name>. But little h&#230;morrhage attended the operation, which was performed
    by the antero-posterior flap method, four ligatures being applied. Chloroform constituted the an&#230;sthetic
    and the patient reacted promptly. The wound united by first intention, and by November 8th the stump
    had almost entirely healed, there being no indication of reappearance of any tumor.  The tumor, when
    removed, had been examined by <name type="person" key="xxx">Dr. J. M. Da Costa</name>, of <name type="place">Philadelphia</name>, and pronounced to be undoubtedly
    carcinomatous.&#34;  The patient was subsequently transferred to Haddington Hospital, where he was supplied with a &#34;Palmer&#34; artificial limb. He was ultimately discharged from service, at Broad Street Hospital, <date type="servicedischarge" when="1864-12-16">December 16. 1864</date>, and pensioned.  A wet preparation of the shaft of the tibia of the amputated
    limb, exhibiting the tumor at the upper third of the bone, was contributed to <name type="hospital" key="431">the Museum</name>
    by <name type="person" key="xxx">the operator</name>, and constitutes specimen 2779 of the <hi rend="italic">Surgical Section</hi>.  The pensioner was inspected on <date type="pension" when="1882-02-01">February 1, 1882</date>, by <name type="person" key="xxx">Examining Surgeon O. Warner</name>, of <name type="place">Paterson, New Jersey</name>, who reported that he found the &#34;stump small, shrunken, painful, tender, and sore on the end, so that it is impossible for an artificial limb
    to be worn with any comfort or benefit.&#34;</p>
