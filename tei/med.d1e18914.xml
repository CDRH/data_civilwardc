                                                  perforated the liver on the anterior and inferior
                                                  surface of the right lobe, laterally, cut through
                                                  the spleen, tore away its lower portion, cut into
                                                  the left kidney, into which it impacted particles
                                                  of bone, perforated the right kidney through the
                                                  superior anterior edge, fractured the third lumbar

                                                  eleventh ribs on the left side, external to the
                                                  axillary line. The omentum major protruded six

                                                  thoracic cavity was filled with blood. The

                                                  liver. The pathological specimen of the fractured
                                                  vertebra is No. 1647, Section I, A. M. M.  The
