     Gleason</name>, <name type="organization" key="552">Co. B, 2d New Hampshire Heavy
     Artillery</name>, aged 18 years, was accidentally wounded at <name type="place"
     key="#Washington">Washington</name>, <date type="injury" when="1864-05-10">May 10, 1864</date>,
    by a pistol ball, which entered the upper third of the left thigh anteriorly. He was conveyed to
     <name type="hospital" key="162">Douglas Hospital</name>, where py&#230;mia subsequently
    appeared, the first chill occurring on May 26th, and being preceded by marked icterus. The ball
    could not be discovered. Secondary h&#230;morrhage from the femoral artery to the amount of
    fourteen ounces occurred on May 31st, and to the amount of fifteen ounces on the next day, still
    further adding to the patient's depression. His death occurred on <date type="death"
     when="1864-06-01">June 1, 1864</date>. At the autopsy the whole body was found to be deeply
    tinged with bile. No metastatic abscesses were discovered. The knee joint was found to be
    disorganized, as was also the hip joint on the wounded side, and a large dark-colored cavity
    existed in the injured thigh, which had been an immense abscess. No secondary deposits were seen
    in the lungs. On dividing the femur longitudinally, the medullary canal and cancellated portion
    of the bone were found in a diseased condition. The medulla was softened, of a dark red color,
    and in the early stage of that change which is seen in well-marked cases of py&#230;mia after
    amputation, when this material is found of a dark green color and in a state of advanced
    decomposition. Before death the patient had wandering delirium for days, profuse perspiration,
    chills, a rapid feeble pulse, and icteroid hue. The upper third of the injured thigh,
    longitudinally bisected, and showing an impacted pistol ball, which penetrated the base of the
    neck and lodged in the cancellated portion, constitutes specimen 3540 of the <hi rend="italic"
