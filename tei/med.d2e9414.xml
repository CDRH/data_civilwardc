      Hammond</name>, <name type="organization" key="364">126th New York</name>, noted his entrance
     into the field hospital of the 1st division, Second
     Corps, with "shot wound of left thigh." The wounded man reached <name type="place" key="#Washington">Washington</name> <date
      type="transfer" when="1865-04-03">April 3d</date>, and was admitted to the <name type="hospital"
       key="171">Armory Square Hospital</name>, whence <name type="person" key="424">Acting Assistant
        Surgeon G. K. Smith</name> reported the following history: "The missile, a mini&#233; ball, entered
     the anterior portion of the thigh at the junction of the middle and lower thirds, and, passing
     horizontally backward, fractured the femur and made its exit posteriorly. The constitutional
     disturbance resulting from the injury was very slight, the discharge of pus from the wound
     amounting to only about half an ounce in twenty-four hours. The limb was shortened two inches.
     It was placed on a <choice><orig>mattrass</orig><reg>mattress</reg></choice>, between two sand bags, and extension was applied with a sixteen
     pound weight. Muriated tincture of iron was ordered; but no stimulants were given. By April
     15th, the discharge amounted to only one drachm daily, and the limb was shortened only one and
     a quarter inches. On May 11th, believing the fragments to be firmly united, I allowed the
     extension to be removed and the patient to ride on the invalid chair, and, on measuring the
     limb, I found that it was still shortened three-quarters of an inch. I reapplied the weight;
     but this contraction could not be overcome by any amount of extension that the patient could
     bear. He was now kept in bed until June 9th, at which time the fragments had firmly united and
     he commenced walking on crutches. No fragments of bone were ever removed from the limb." The
     patient was transferred to the <name type="place">Readville</name> Hospital
     <date type="transfer" when="1865-07-05">July 5th</date>, and subsequently to Dale Hospital, <name type="place">Worcester</name>, where he was discharged and

     contraction of the flexors of the thigh." The pensioner enlisted in the <name

Galloupe</name>, of <name type="place" key="xx">Lynn, Massachusetts</name>, certified, in <date type="pension" when="1869">1869</date>: "A musket ball passed through the left thigh, fracturing the femur. The wound is healed and the bone appears to be sound. The limb is
     shortened and he walks slow and with difficulty," etc. In <date type="pension" when="1874-06">June, 1874</date>, the same Examiner
     reported: "In walking he does not touch the heel, but rests on the forward part of the foot,
     thus making locomotion slow and fatiguing. The limb is painful when much used and in cold
     weather. The femur is enlarged and the foot is swollen." The pensioner was paid <date type="pension" when="1879-06-04">June 4, 1879</date>.  <hi rend="initialcap">F</hi>IG. 2 of <hi rend="initialcap">P</hi>LATE LXIII, opp. p. 196,
