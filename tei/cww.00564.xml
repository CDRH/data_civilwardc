                        the same may be found.</note>
                    <seg type="handwritten">By purchase from <persName>Thomas Bayne</persName> on
                        the <date when="1853-05-20">20th day of May 1853</date>, for three hundred
                        and fifty dollars, as appears from a Bill of Sale</seg> to her late Husband
                        <persName>Richard Gibson</persName> deceased which is herewith presented.
                    Said <persName>Ellen Worthy</persName> is now held under a Marriage Contract in

                        Ward</persName>, Trustees.</p>

                <p>That your petitioner's claim to the service or labor of said <seg type="handwritten"><persName>Ellen Worthy</persName></seg> was, at the time
                    of said discharge therefrom, of the value of <seg type="handwritten">five
                        hundred</seg> dollars in money.<note type="government" place="foot" xml:id="n3">Here state such facts, if any there be, touching the value of
                        the petitioner's claim to the service or labor of the person, as may enhance
                        the same, and also such facts, if any, touching the moral, mental, and
                        bodily infirmities or defects of said person, as impair the value of the
                        petitioner's claim to such service or labor, and conclude such statement
                        with an averment that the petitioner knows of no other infirmities or
                        defects of said person which impair the value of petitioner's claim to such
                        service or labor, and that he believes none other to exist. If the
                        petitioner specify no such infirmity or defect, then his statement touching
                        the value of his claim should conclude with an averment that he has no
                        knowledge of any such infirmity or defect.</note><seg type="handwritten">She
                        believes her worth that amount because one person expressed a willingness to
                        buy her at that price before the Act passed, and many have pronounced her a
                        valuable servant and been anxious to buy her. She believed that no mental,
                        moral, or bodily infirmities exist to impair her value, except the slight
                        tumor in her side, before referred to.</seg></p>

                <p>Your petitioner hereby declares that <seg type="handwritten">she</seg> bears true
                    and faithful allegiance to the Government of the <placeName>United

                    arms against the <placeName>United States</placeName> in the present rebellion,
                    nor in any way given aid or comfort thereto.</p>

                <p>And your petitioner further states and alleges, that <seg type="handwritten">she</seg> has not brought said <seg type="handwritten"><persName>Ellen
                            Worthy</persName></seg> into the <placeName>District of
                        Columbia</placeName> since the passage of said act of Congress; and that, at
                    the time of the passage thereof, said <seg type="handwritten"><persName>Ellen
                            Worthy</persName></seg> was held to service or labor therein under and
                    by virtue of your petitioner's claim to such service or labor.</p>

                <p>Your petitioner further states and alleges, that <seg type="handwritten">her</seg> said claim to the service or labor of said <seg type="handwritten"><persName>Ellen Worthy</persName></seg> does not
                    originate in or by virtue of any transfer heretofore made by any person who has
                    in any manner aided or sustained the present rebellion against the Government of
                    the <placeName>United States</placeName>.</p>

                <p>And your petitioner prays the said Commissioners to investigate and determine the
                    validity of <seg type="handwritten">her</seg> said claim to the service or labor
                    of said <seg type="handwritten"><persName>Ellen Worthy</persName></seg> herein
                    above set forth; and if the same be found to be valid, that they appraise and
                    apportion the value of said claim in money, and report the same to the Secretary
                    of the Treasury of the <placeName>United States</placeName>, in conformity to
                    the provisions of said act of Congress.</p>
