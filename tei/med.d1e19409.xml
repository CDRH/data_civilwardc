        <hi rend="initialcap">C</hi>ASE.—<name type="person">Private Samuel McCalecher</name>,
          <name type="organization">Co. D, 3d Pennsylvania Reserves</name>, was wounded at <name type="BATTLE" key="127">Bull Run, Virginia</name>, <date type="injury" when="1862-08-28">August 28th, 1862</date>, by a round ball, which entered two inches above the right
        nipple and lodged beneath the skin three inches below the inferior angle of the right
        scapula, comminuting the tenth rib in its exit from the chest cavity. He was treated in the
        field till <date type="admit" when="1862-09-03">September 3d</date>, and then transferred to
        the <name type="hospital" key="504">Baptist Church Hospital</name>, <name type="place">Alexandria</name>. Bloody sputa occurred occasionally for two days after admission, and
        the patient suffered from pain in the right lower lobe on drawing a full breath. These
        symptoms soon ceased. On September 12th, slight crepitation was heard over the lower part of
        the right lung. On <date type="operation" when="1962-09-15">September 15th</date>, <name type="person">Acting Assistant Surgeon George F. French</name> extracted the ball from
        beneath the skin. The patient continued to improve, and by November 11th, was apparently
        well, with diminished respiratory murmur in the lower right lobe. He was discharged from
        service on <date type="servicedischarge" when="1862-12-01">December 1st 1862</date>. The
        missile, which is irregularly and roughly battered, was forwarded to <name type="hospital" key="431">the Museum</name>. It is represented in the wood-cut (<hi rend="initialcap">F</hi>IG. 230). <name type="person">Pension Examiner H. M. Nagle</name> reports, <date type="pension" when="1867-04-11">April 11th, 1867</date>, that "the right lung is
        affected; has great pain, with weakness in chest, considerable cough and dyspnœa, which
        is on the increase, so that he is unable to perform any but light manual labor. General
        health very good. Disability three-fourths and permanent." </p>
