                                                  wound. There were no symptoms, except a diminished
                                                  vesicular murmur along the course of the wound.
                                                  Tonics, stimulants, and expectorants were
                                                  administered. The discharge gradually diminished,
                                                  and the patient improved. On March 1st, after some

                                                  wound was still discharging, and he suffered
                                                  occasionally with violent attacks of coughing,
