                    Fisher</name>, <name type="organization" key="209">Co. G, 98th Pennsylvania
                    Volunteers</name>, was wounded near <name type="place">Fort Stevens,
                    Washington</name>, <date type="injury" when="1864-07-12">July 12th, 1864</date>,
                and was admitted into <name type="hospital" key="165">Mount Pleasant Hospital</name>
                on <date type="admit" when="1864-07-13">the following day</date>. A little above the
                right ear was a scalp wound an inch and a half long. <name type="person" key="1570">Acting Assistant Surgeon P. C. Porter</name>, under whose care the patient
                came, satisfied himself that a piece of the mastoid process was chipped off, and
                that a fracture extended into the petrous portion of the temporal. From the aspect
                of the wound, <name type="person" key="1570">Dr. Porter</name> was inclined to the
                belief that it was inflicted by a conoidal musket ball. The patient did well with
                simple dressings, and rest, and gentle cathartics, till the <date type="injury" when="1864-07-20">20th of July</date>, when the wound began to slough.
                Applications of charcoal and yeast poultices, nitric acid, and creasote, failed to
                arrest the sloughing, which presently gave rise to repeated hæmorrhages from
                branches of the temporal artery. The gangrene continued to spread until August 9th,
                when the eschars separated, leaving a space five inches in diameter on the right
                side of the head, denuded of integument, fascia, and muscles. During this long
                period, the patient complained of no inconvenience at the seat of fracture, though
                there was at times acute frontal pain. Early in September, it was evident that the
                exposed portions of the temporal and parietal bones were necrosed, and on <date type="operation" when="1864-09-06">September 6th</date>, a fragment of the
                squamous portion of the temporal was removed. <date type="operation" when="1864-09-08">Two days subsequently</date> other fragments were detached and
                extracted. After this the wound began to cicatrize rapidly, and on <date type="injury" when="1864-12-03">December 3d, 1864</date>, the patient was
                reported to be entirely out of danger, and in fact nearly well. On <date type="servicedischarge" when="1865-02-14">February 14th, 1865</date>, he was
                discharged from service on a certificate of disability signed by <name type="person" key="245">Surgeon H. Allen</name>, <name type="organization" key="190">U. S.
                    A.</name> He was pensioned. In <date type="pension" when="1865">1865</date>, he
                was reported as partially deaf. He was last paid at the <name type="place">Philadelphia Agency</name>, <date type="pension" when="1870-09-04">September
                    4th, 1870</date>, and his pension had been reduced, from which it may be
                inferred that the examining surgeon regarded his disabilities as comparatively
                slight.</p>
