Head, neck and spinal column not examined. There were slight pleuritic adhesions posteriorly on both sides. Both lungs were engorged with blood, and did not collapse when the sternum was removed. The heart was normal; there were large, very firm yellow clots in both auricles, and small ones in both ventricles; the auricular clot on the left side extended about six inches into the branches of the left pulmonary veins; these veins emptied into the heart by a single opening. The omentum was congested. The liver was large, but otherwise healthy; the gall-bladder contained about an ounce of dark bile. The spleen was normal. The pancreas a little congested, but otherwise healthy. Both kidneys were congested. The mesenteric glands were somewhat congested and enlarged. The mucous membrane of the ileum, for twelve inches from the ileo-c&#230;cal valve, was thickened, inflamed, and ulcerated; it was very dark colored, and appeared almost gangrenous in many places. The mucous membrane of the colon and rectum was inflamed and ulcerated; the ulcers had ragged edges, and were arranged in narrow bands around the circumference of the gut; in other parts of the mucous membrane there were whitish deposits of pseudomembranous lymph.&#8212;<name type="person" key="655">Acting Assistant Surgeon Thomas Bowen</name>.</p>
