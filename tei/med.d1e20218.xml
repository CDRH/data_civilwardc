                                                  the spinous processes, between the tenth and

                                                  near the wound of exit. The track of the ball was
                                                  five inches long. He was taken prisoner and

                                                  had suffered from dyspn&#339;a. His expectoration was

                                                  became very tender on pressure. A harassing cough
                                                  and increasing dyspn&#339;a indicated the presence of
                                                  traumatic pleuritis. The treatment comprised
                                                  diuretics, expectorants, with sedatives to procure

                                                  expectorated freely an enormous quantity of

                                                  some dyspn&#339;a. After consultation, paracentesis
                                                  thoracis was decided upon, and <name type="person" key="200">Assistant Surgeon William Thomson</name>, <name type="organization" key="190">U. S. A.</name>, introduced a trocar
                                                  into the posterior lateral angle of the right
                                                  chest, between the tenth and eleventh ribs, which
                                                  was followed immediately by the exit of
                                                  thirty-eight fluid ounces of pus. The operation
                                                  was unaccompanied by pain and produced almost
                                                  instantaneous relief from the dyspn&#339;a. The

                                                  Stimulants were freely administered. In the
                                                  afternoon, the patient appeared to be in a
                                                  moribund state, but toward night he rallied
                                                  considerably and felt comparatively comfortable.
                                                  He passed a restless night, though he breathed
                                                  easier than before the operation. At seven and a
                                                  half A. M., he said he felt strong and hopeful, but
                                                  he died at quarter to ten o'clock A. M., <date type="death" when="1863-12-09">December
