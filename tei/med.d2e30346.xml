     Stewart</name>, <name type="organization" key="xxx">Co. F, 2d Maine</name>, aged 44 years, was
    wounded at <name type="BATTLE" key="6">Bull Run</name>, <date type="injury" when="1861-07-21"
     >July 21, 1861</date>, and admitted to the <name type="hospital" key="445">E street
     Infirmary</name>, at Washington, on <date type="admit" when="1861-07-22">the following
     day</date>. <name type="person" key="xxx">Assistant Surgeon J. W. S. Gourley</name>, <name
     type="organization" key="190">U. S. A.</name>, contributed the specimen with the following
    minutes of the case: &#34;The patient was shot in the left elbow, the ball having been extracted
    previous to his admission. The missile entered at the external and posterior part of the elbow.
    On the day subsequent to his admission erysipelas set in, and was followed by very profuse
    suppuration and burrowing of pus nearly midway up the arm. Free incisions were made for the
    escape of pus, and the arm kept still, with a hope of performing a secondary resection of the
    elbow, which had been objected to when the patient was first seen. But about <date
     type="operation" when="1861-08">one month after the injury</date> he had become so feeble, and
    his condition was such, that longer delay would have been fatal, and amputation at the middle
    third was resorted to as the only means of preserving his life. From that moment his condition
    improved, and the bed-sores which he had healed, he having meanwhile been placed on a water-bed
    kindly furnished by <name type="person" key="xxx">Dr. T. Foster Jenkins</name>, of the <name
     type="organization" key="xxx">Sanitary Commission</name>. The patient was discharged from
    hospital, cured, on <date type="hospitaldischarge" when="1861-09-21">September 21st</date>.&#34;
    On <date type="servicedischarge" when="1861-10-02">October 2, 1861</date>, the patient was
    discharged from service and pensioned. On <date type="pension" when="1864-12-21">December 21,
     1864</date>, an artificial arm was furnished by <name type="person" key="xxx">Mr.
     Lincoln</name>, of <name type="place">Boston</name>, who described the case as a &#34;circular
    amputation at the middle of the arm,&#34; and the stump as &#34;healed.&#34; This pensioner died
    on <date type="death" when="1869-01-23">January 23, 1869</date>. The specimen (<hi
     rend="initialcap">F</hi>IG. 555) consists of the lower half of the left humerus, from which the
    outer condyle has been carried away, and a large fragment of the shaft split off and afterward
    partially reunited.</p>
