                                        anorexia and pain in the back. The case on admission was
                                        diagnosed typhoid fever. On the 3d the patient was dull and
                                        stupid, his eyes suffused, cheeks congested, pulse 100, skin
                                        hot and dry, tongue dry and clean, lips and teeth covered

                                        gurgling in the right iliac region; twelve grains of quinine
                                        were given at once, followed after a time by a half-ounce
                                        dose of castor oil and by turpentine emulsion every three
                                        hours. Next day one stool was passed; the patient had some
                                        cough and hepatic tenderness, and vibices appeared on the
                                        chest. On the 6th he had tinnitus aurium. On the 8th he
                                        seemed better; his tongue was red at the tip and edges and
                                        coated white in the centre; his bowels had been moved but
                                        once since the day following his admission. He improved
                                        gradually after this, and was transferred to <name type="place">Baltimore, Md.</name>,
