Dysentery.  At the time of admission he had discharges from his bowels every three or four hours; the stools were very offensive, dark colored, grumous, and contained blood and pus; the pulse was small and rapid.

The external surface of the large intestine was of a dark lead-color; its mucous membrane highly congested, softened, and gangrenous in spots. The liver and spleen were healthy.</p> 
   <p>⃰ It is to be regretted that, in most instances, the records of this hospital do not show by whom the autopsies were made. It is known that many of them were made by <name type="person" key="134">Surgeon Bentley</name> himself, or under his immediate supervision, but it is only possible to distinguish these from the others in a few cases.</p>
