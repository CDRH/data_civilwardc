                <p>That your petitioner acquired <seg type="handwritten">his</seg> claim to the

                        the same may be found.</note>
                    <seg type="handwritten">He was purchased, solely for his own benefit &#38; with

                        purchase took place in <date when="1855-10">October, 1855</date>. Since that period said <persName>Jo:
                            Brown</persName> has paid your petitioner from time to time sums
                        amounting in all to about $350, after deducting money for various purposes
                        advanced by your petitioner to said <persName>Jo: Brown</persName> since the
                        time of his purchase.</seg></p>

                <p>That your petitioner's claim to the service or labor of said <seg
                        type="handwritten"><persName>Jo: Brown</persName></seg> was, at the time of
                    said discharge therefrom, of the value of <seg type="handwritten">about
                        $250</seg> dollars in money.<note
                        type="government" place="foot" xml:id="n3">Here state such facts, if any
                        there be, touching the value of the petitioner's claim to the service or
                        labor of the person, as may enhance the same, and also such facts, if any,
                        touching the moral, mental, and bodily infirmities or defects of said
                        person, as impair the value of the petitioner's claim to such service or
                        labor, and conclude such statement with an averment that the petitioner
                        knows of no other infirmities or defects of said person which impair the
                        value of petitioner's claim to such service or labor, and that he believes
                        none other to exist. If the petitioner specify no such infirmity or defect,
                        then his statement touching the value of his claim should conclude with an
                        averment that he has no knowledge of any such infirmity or
                        defect.</note><seg type="handwritten">, with interest on that

                        impair his value, except the partial loss of two fingers of his right hand.
                        This defect existed at the time of his purchase by your petitioner. In all
                        other respects said <persName>Jo: Brown</persName> is believed to be in good
                        bodily condition and his habits to be ordinarily good.</seg></p>

                <p>Your petitioner hereby declares that <seg type="handwritten">he</seg> bears true and faithful allegiance
                    to the Government of the United States, and that <seg type="handwritten">he</seg> has not borne arms against the
                    United States in the present rebellion, nor in any way given aid or comfort
                    thereto.</p>

                <p>And your petitioner further states and alleges, that <seg type="handwritten">he</seg> has not brought said <seg type="handwritten"><persName>Jo: Brown</persName></seg> into the District
                    of Columbia since the passage of said act of Congress; and that, at the time of
                    the passage thereof, said <seg type="handwritten"><persName>Jo: Brown</persName></seg> was held to service or labor therein
                    under and by virtue of your petitioner's claim to such service or labor.</p>

                <p>Your petitioner further states and alleges, that <seg type="handwritten">his</seg> said claim to the service or labor
                    of said <seg type="handwritten"><persName>Jo: Brown</persName></seg> does not
                    originate in or by virtue of any transfer heretofore made by any person who has
                    in any manner aided or sustained the present rebellion against the Government of
                    the United States.</p>

                <p>And your petitioner prays the said Commissioners to investigate and determine the
                    validity of <seg type="handwritten">his</seg> said
                    claim to the service or labor of said <seg type="handwritten"><persName>Jo: Brown</persName></seg> herein above set forth; and if the
                    same be found to be valid, that they appraise and apportion the value of said
                    claim in money, and report the same to the Secretary of the Treasury of the
                    United States, in conformity to the provisions of said act of Congress.</p>
