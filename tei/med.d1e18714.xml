B, 13th North Carolina Regiment</name>, aged 24 years, was wounded at <name type="battle">Williamsburg, Virginia</name>, <date type="injury" when="1862-05-05">May 5th, 1862</date>, by a musket ball,
                    which entered two inches below the spine of the left scapula, passed upward and
                    inward, and escaped midway between the spine of the right scapula and the right
                    clavicle. He was admitted, on <date type="admit" when="1862-05-12">the 12th</date>, to <name type="hospital">Cliffburn Hospital</name>, Washington. A
                    counter opening had been made in the track of the ball to the left of the
                    vertebral column, and from this and the orifice of exit the discharge of pus was profuse. Digital examination through
                    the counter opening showed a shattering of the spinous processes of two of the
                    dorsal vertebrae, and the existence of a large abscess over the muscles to the
                    right of the vertebrae. A free transverse incision was made over the spine, the
                    splinters of bone removed, sharp projecting points; snipped off, and the carious
                    portions gouged away. The cavity left was stuffed for two days with lint soaked
                    in laudanum and subsequently with dry lint. The wound did very well. By <date type="injury" when="1862-07-03">July 3d</date>,
                    the wound had healed; the bullet holes were cicatrizing, and the cavity left by
                    the operation was filling up with granulations. It was dressed lightly from the
                    bottom with dry lint, the edges of the wound being approximated and supported by
                    adhesive straps. By June 30th, the wounds had entirely healed. On <date type="transfer" when="1862-07-11">July 11th,
                        1862</date>, he was transferred to <name type="hospital" key="70">Old Capitol Prison</name>
