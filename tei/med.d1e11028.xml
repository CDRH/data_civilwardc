                                        feverish and complained of cough, acute pain in the right
                                        side and dyspnœa. Small doses of tartar emetic and sulphate
                                        of magnesia were prescribed.  Next day the force and
                                        rapidity of the pulse were reduced, the pain and cough
                                        diminished and the bowels freely opened; but in the evening
                                        he became worse, the pulse rising to 160, the skin becoming

                                        was very weak on the 24th, the abdomen tympanitic and
                                        tender and the stomach irritable. Medicine was omitted and
                                        beef-tea, wine and morphia directed to be used; turpentine
                                        stupes were applied to the abdomen.  He died on <date type="death" when="1864-03-27">the 27th</date>.   <hi rend="italic">Post-mortem</hi> examination: Nearly the whole of the right lung
                                        was solidified and firmly adherent to the thoracic parietes;
                                        the left lung was considerably congested. The inner surface
                                        of the pericardium was roughened with lymph and the sac contained a little fluid. The stomach and intestines
                                        were healthy; the liver and kidneys congested.—<hi rend="italic">Hospital, <name type="place">Alexandria, Va.</name></hi> </p>
