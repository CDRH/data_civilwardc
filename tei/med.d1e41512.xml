   <p>Case from the case-book of the <name type="hospital" key="501"><hi rend="initialcap">T</hi>HIRD <hi rend="initialcap">D</hi>IVISION</name> of the <name type="place" key="#Alexandria"><hi rend="initialcap">A</hi>LEXANDRIA</name> <hi rend="initialcap">H</hi>OSPITAL, <name type="person" key="134">Surgeon Edwin Bentley</name>, <name type="organization" key="132">U. S. V.</name>, in charge:&#8432;</p>
   <p><hi rend="initialcap">C</hi>ASE 483.&#8212;<name type="person" key="xxx">Private Luke Lee</name>, <name type="organization" key="xxx">company E, 2d Maryland Cavalry</name>; admitted <date type="admit" when="1863-02-12">February 12, 1863</date>.  Chronic diarrh&#339;a of over two months standing.  The patient was much emaciated; had no appetite; great thirst; eight or ten painful passages daily.  In the treatment astringents were chiefly relied upon, with Dover's powder or sulphate of morphia at night to induce sleep. Strict attention was paid to the diet, only farinaceous food being allowed. The patient improved gradually, and during the second week in March was allowed to have his clothes. He took cold March 16th. The diarrh&#339;a recurred more severely than ever; he became very much prostrated, and died <date type="death" when="1863-04-14">April 14th</date>.  <hi rend="italic">Autopsy</hi> <date type="autopsy" when="1863-04-15">ten hours after death</date>: The middle and lower lobes of the right lung were congested. There was great constriction and thickening of the coats of the large intestine in the vicinity of the sigmoid flexure, the lumen of the bowel being diminished to about one-fourth its natural diameter.</p> 
   <p>&#8432; It is to be regretted that, in most instances, the records of this hospital do not show by whom the autopsies were made. It is known that many of them were made by <name type="person" key="134">Surgeon Bentley</name> himself, or under his immediate supervision, but it is only possible to distinguish these from the others in a few cases.</p>
