C.; <name type="person" key="242">Assistant Surgeon Roberts Bartholow</name>, <name type="organization" key="190">U. S. A.</name>, in charge from August 21st to December, 1863.</p>
   <p><hi rend="initialcap">C</hi>ASE 390.&#8212;<name type="person" key="xxx">Private Peleg Mitchell</name>, <name type="organization" key="xxx">company D, 16th Maine volunteers</name>; age 61; admitted <date type="admit" when="1863-10-19">October 19, 1863</date>.  Diarrh&#339;a and erysipelas.  This man was taken sick with diarrh&#339;a near <name type="place">Fairfax Court-House, Virginia</name>, <date type="injury" when="1863-10-16">October 16th</date>. His bowels were moved from ten to fifteen times daily; his stomach was irritable.  October 23d: The patient vomits continually; tongue coated with thick white fur; pulse 108 and scarcely perceptible; extremities cold.  November 3d: Is much better; the vomiting has ceased and the diarrh&#339;a is nearly checked.  November 13th: The bowels have been quite regular for a day or so, but are loose again. He had rheumatic pains when admitted, which have now disappeared.  December 14th: Facial erysipelas has set in and the diarrh&#339;a has returned; the discharges are frequent; the abdomen is tender; pulse 110 and feeble.  December 16th: The erysipelatous symptoms are better, but the patient is much prostrated; the diarrh&#339;a continues.  December 18th: The erysipelas has nearly subsided; the prostration continues; there is no pain, and the evacuations are involuntary but not very frequent.  Died, <date type="death" when="1863-12-19">December 19th</date>.  This patient had from six to eight ounces of milk-punch per day.  <hi rend="italic">Autopsy</hi> <date type="autopsy" when="1863-12-20">next day</date>: Body not emaciated; adipose tissue quite abundant. Brain not examined. The lower lobes of both lungs were congested; the lungs otherwise were healthy. The heart was paler than natural. The liver had the nutmeg appearance to a slight degree. The pancreas was white and firm. The spleen was firm, very dark, and filled with black blood. The kidneys were congested. The mucous membrane of the ileum was perfectly healthy, and there was no enlargement of the closed glands.  [The condition of the large intestine is not recorded.]&#8212;<name type="person" key="245">Assistant Surgeon Harrison Allen</name>, <name type="organization" key="190">U. S. A.</name>&#8432;</p>
   <p>&#8432; September 14, 1864, <name type="person" key="245">Dr. Allen</name> presented to the Pathological Society of Philadelphia a brief &#34;<hi rend="italic">Synopsis of Autopsies made at <name type="hospital" key="176">Lincoln General Hospital</name></hi>,&#34; to which the reader is referred.&#8212;(Proceedings of the Pathological Society of Philadelphia, in the American Journal of the Medical Sciences, January, 1865, page 133.)  In this paper he analyzes the appearances observed in forty-one cases of diarrh&#339;a and dysentery, thirty-five of fever, twenty-one of pneumonia, and five of diphtheria. The notes of <name type="person" key="245">Dr. Allen</name>'s autopsies, from which the accounts here presented have been condensed, were not contained in the case-books of <name type="hospital" key="176">Lincoln hospital</name> turned in to the <name type="organization" key="xxx">Surgeon General's Office</name> at the close of the war, but have since been copied into them from the originals, loaned for the purpose.</p>
