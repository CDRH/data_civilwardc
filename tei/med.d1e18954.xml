          N——</name>, <name type="organization">Co. C, 142d Pennsylvania
          Volunteers</name>, having been wounded at <name type="BATTLE" key="251">Fredericksburg</name>, <date type="injury" when="1862-12-13">December 13th</date>, was
        admitted to hospital at <name type="place">Alexandria</name>, <date type="admit" when="1862-12-19">December 19th, 1862</date>. A ball had entered one inch and a half above
        the outer third of the right clavicle and lodged. The patient was weak, and had an anxious
        countenance; there was considerable dyspnœa, with a full but weak pulse, and
        suppuration from the wound was profuse. On December 23d, diarrhœa set in, attended with
        anorexia; otherwise the condition of the patient remained unchanged. The diarrhœa
        became worse by the 28th, and dyspnœa increased, the breath passing through the wound.
        The patient died on <date type="death" when="1862-12-31">December 31st, 1862</date>, with
        very great dyspnœa. At the autopsy, it was found that the ball had passed
        longitudinally through the inferior lobe of the right lung, impinged upon the body of one of
        the dorsal vertebræ, a splinter of which still adheres to the ball, and lodged under
        the greater curvature of the stomach. There was red hepitization of the injured lung, and a
        little pus was found in the thorax. There was nothing to indicate the occurrence of
        hæmorrhage. The treatment of this case was expectant. The missile was contributed to
        the <name type="hospital" key="431">Army Medical Museum</name>, with the foregoing account,
        by <name type="person">Acting Assistant Surgeon G. F. French</name>. It is represented in
