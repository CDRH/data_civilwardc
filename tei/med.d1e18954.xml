          N&#8212;&#8212;</name>, <name type="organization">Co. C, 142d Pennsylvania
          Volunteers</name>, having been wounded at <name type="BATTLE" key="251"
          >Fredericksburg</name>, <date type="injury" when="1862-12-13">December 13th</date>, was
        admitted to hospital at <name type="place">Alexandria</name>, <date type="admit"
          when="1862-12-19">December 19th, 1862</date>. A ball had entered one inch and a half above
        the outer third of the right clavicle and lodged. The patient was weak, and had an anxious
        countenance; there was considerable dyspn&#339;a, with a full but weak pulse, and
        suppuration from the wound was profuse. On December 23d, diarrh&#339;a set in, attended with
        anorexia; otherwise the condition of the patient remained unchanged. The diarrh&#339;a
        became worse by the 28th, and dyspn&#339;a increased, the breath passing through the wound.
        The patient died on <date type="death" when="1862-12-31">December 31st, 1862</date>, with
        very great dyspn&#339;a. At the autopsy, it was found that the ball had passed
        longitudinally through the inferior lobe of the right lung, impinged upon the body of one of
        the dorsal vertebr&#230;, a splinter of which still adheres to the ball, and lodged under
        the greater curvature of the stomach. There was red hepitization of the injured lung, and a
        little pus was found in the thorax. There was nothing to indicate the occurrence of
        h&#230;morrhage. The treatment of this case was expectant. The missile was contributed to
        the <name type="hospital" key="431">Army Medical Museum</name>, with the foregoing account,
        by <name type="person">Acting Assistant Surgeon G. F. French</name>. It is represented in
