     was wounded <date type="injury" when="1861-10-05">October 5, 1861</date>, by a round musket ball, which entered near the fold of the left natis, struck the left
     femur at the digital fossa, splintered the neck into the articulation, and made its exit
     outside the vessels anteriorly. He was conveyed to the <name type="hospital" key="445">E street
      Infirmary</name>, Washington, on <date type="admit" when="1861-10-05">the same day</date>. A stream of blood and another of clear and
     pellucid synovia issued from the wound of exit. There was but little constitutional irritation,
     the pulse was but slightly depressed, and the patient congratulated himself on having escaped
     with what he regarded as a slight injury. On the morning of <date type="operation" when="1861-10-06">October 6th</date> <name type="person"
      key="287">Assistant Surgeon John W. S. Gouley</name>, <name type="organization" key="190">U.
      S. A.</name>, assisted by <name type="person" key="944">Surgeon C. H. Laub</name>, <name
      type="organization" key="190">U. S. A.</name>, <name type="person" key="945">Assistant Surgeon
      C. B. White</name>, <name type="organization" key="190">U. S. A.</name>, <name type="person"
      key="946">Surgeon T. Sim</name>, and <name type="person" key="947">Assistant Surgeon H. E.
      Brown</name>, proceeded to operate. Insensibility having been induced by chloroform, <name
      type="person" key="287">Dr. Gouley</name> made an incision seven inches long, commencing above
     and behind the trochanter major and continued downward in the axis of the limb. The neck of the
     bone was found to be badly shattered, but the fracture did not extend to the shaft. A section
     through the great trochanter and base of the neck was made with the chain saw. The head of the
     bone was then disarticulated and removed, and the fragments of the neck were extracted. There
     was very little loss of blood. The wound having been approximated and dressed simply, the
     patient was put to bed, and the limb was kept in position by pads and cushions. Surgical fever
     set in soon after the operation; py&#230;mia was developed, and the patient gradually sank, and
     died on <date type="death" when="1861-10-12">October 12, 1861</date>. His friends would not
     permit an autopsy. The pathological specimen and <name type="person" key="287">Dr.
      Gouley</name>'s notes of the case were destroyed in the conflagration which shortly afterwards
     consumed the <name type="hospital" key="445">Infirmary</name>.  </p>
