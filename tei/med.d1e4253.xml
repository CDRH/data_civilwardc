                                                16, 1861</date>, was taken with intermittent fever, which persisted
                                        notwithstanding the use of quinine and opium. He was

                                                >the 30th</date> as a case of typhoid fever. His eyes
                                        were dull, pulse 96, skin natural, tongue moist but furred
                                        white; he had pain in the bones and anorexia, cough and pain
                                        in the chest, three stools daily with tympanites, iliac
                                        tenderness and some gurgling. Opium, antimony and blue-mass
                                        in small doses were given every three hours. Next day the
                                        pulse was 112, skin somewhat hot, eyes injected and
                                        suffused, tongue moist, furred in the centre and red at the
                                        edges, bowels much meteorized and tender at the umbilicus.
                                        Quinine was given with turpentine emulsion in place of the
                                        mercurial. The quinine was continued on the 2d and tincture
                                        of iron ordered on the 3d, the pulse having meanwhile fallen
                                        to 85, the tongue become cleaner and the appetite improved.
                                        A diarrh&#339;a of four stools daily set in on the 4th,
                                        followed on the 5th by epigastric pain, intestinal gurgling,
                                        tenderness in the right iliac region and in the course of
                                        the transverse colon, and on the 6th by loss of appetite and
                                        irritability of the stomach. Seven stools were passed on the
                                        9th and three on the 10th, after which the attack gradually
                                        declined; during this time there was some head-pain with
                                        dizziness and tinnitus aurium, and the tongue remaining red
                                        at the tip and edges became covered elsewhere with yellowish
                                        patches. Conjunctivitis, which appeared on the 11th, was
                                        treated with a zinc wash. On the 14th the pulse was 56 and
                                        regular, the skin natural, the tongue moist and clean and
                                        the appetite good. The patient was transferred to <name type="place">Annapolis,
