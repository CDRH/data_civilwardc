     <name type="person" key="305">Assistant Surgeon W. Webster</name>, <name type="organization"
     key="190">U. S. A.</name>, forwarded the specimen (<hi rend="initialcap">F</hi>IG. 141), and
    recorded the following history: "The wound was caused by a conoidal ball, which entered on the
    outer side of the lower portion of the upper third of the left thigh, and was extracted through
    the gluteus maximus muscle on a level with and two inches from the anus, same side. The missile
    produced a compound fracture of the femur at the upper third and shortened the limb to the
    extent of two inches. On admission, the patient, who was of robust and healthy appearance, had
    considerable fever and constipation of the bowels. There was extensive swelling of the
    integuments, and he was suffering acute pain. Vedder's long splint was applied, and extension
    from the ankle and counter-extension by a perineal band was made. By these means the limb was
    lengthened one inch and retained in that position. The acute pain rendered any further extension
    impracticable. The patient was ordered to take one-half ounce of castor oil, and sulphate of
    morphia at night to relieve the pain. May 18th, the wound has been dressed with poultices of
    flaxseed meal; the swelling has some what subsided and there is no fever. The pain continues,
    and to relieve it and promote sleep a mixture of two drachms of elixir of opium and one ounce of
    camphor water is given in two doses every evening. June 2d, the discharge has ceased and the
    external wound is nearly closed. There are some signs of union and of the deposition of abundant
    provisional callus. June 10th, the splint was removed; the shortening of the limb now amounts to
    three inches. June 16th, the patient was this morning attacked with chills and the initiatory
    symptoms of fever, a frequent and very weak pulse and red tongue, also great tenderness in the
    epigastric region, with frequent vomiting. The above symptoms continued without intermission
    until terminated in death, at 11 o'clock P. M., on <date type="death" when="1862-06-18">June 18,
     1862</date>. The <hi rend="italic">autopsy</hi>, ten hours after death, confirmed the previous
    diagnosis of acute gastro-enteritis. The coats of the stomach were found to be intensely
    congested, with disorganization of the mucous membrane, which appeared to be greatest about the
    greater curvature of the stomach. The fracture was found firmly consolidated, with abundant
    deposition of provisional callus." The specimen consists of the upper half of the fractured
    femur, showing partial union at right angles and the shaft roughened by the action of pus, also
    callus somewhat copiously thrown out and entangling the fragments, but the inner surfaces being
    carious.</p>
