                    shell which fractured the external table over the occipital protuberance. The
                    wound in the scalp was nearly two inches long.  He was conveyed to <name type="place" key="#Washington">Washington</name>,
                    and on <date type="admit" when="1862-09-01">September 1st</date> was admitted
                    into the <name type="hospital" key="436">Unitarian Church hospital</name>.  Slight paralysis of the left arm and leg existed, and the wound was painful.
                    Cold water dressings were applied, an ounce of sulphate of magnesia was
                    administered and a restricted diet ordered. The patient was more or less
                    delirious for two days.  On September 30th he had so far recovered as to be able
                    to walk about the ward, and the wound had nearly healed. He experienced no
                    inconvenience from the injury except on exposure to the sun.   The case is
                    reported by <name type="person" key="1353">Surgeon A. Wynkoop</name>, <name type="organization" key="132">U. S. V.</name>   The patient was discharged

                        1863</date>, that this was a "fracture of the skull, carrying away a portion
                    of its substance." The wound was nearly healed, and the patient suffered from
                    throbbing pain and giddiness on active exertion. His disability was rated as
                    total, but probably temporary.</p>
