The case-book of the hospital gives the following particulars: This man had typhoid fever eight or nine years ago, followed by enfeeblement of the limbs, in consequence of which he was unable to walk for months. He says his limbs were never so strong again; nevertheless, he was well enough to enlist <date type="enlist" when="1864-04-04">April 4, 1864</date>, and was sent at once to the field. <date type="injury" when="1864-05">Six weeks after enlistment</date> he was attacked by dysentery, which was followed by his present trouble. He is now unable to walk, and complains of a feeling as if a rope were tied tightly around his hips; sensation is less impaired than motion; he feels a touch on the legs, but does not perceive painful impressions as distinctly on the lower as on the upper extremities. The record shows that this man was discharged the service <date type="servicedischarge" when="1864-12-21">December 21st</date>, because of "partial paralysis of the lower extremities."</p>
