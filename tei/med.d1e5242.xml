                                        and slight crepitus
                                        in the right infraclavicular region. Suitable nourishment
                                        was ordered with sweet spirit of nitre and Dover's powder at
                                        bedtime. On the 24th two small pustules with inflammatory
                                        areolæ were observed above the left knee. A

                                        inches above the wrist. Chloride of zinc solution was used
                                        locally. The spots enlarged slowly, and on May 3 a pustule
                                        with a large inflammatory base appeared on the mucous
                                        membrane of the left side of the lower lip. On the 5th there
                                        was low delirium; the left side of the face was swollen and
                                        the gangrenous spot on the lip was as large as a penny and
                                        increasing rapidly; the diarrhœa meanwhile
                                        continued. The patient became unconscious and died on
