     middle of the thigh by <name type="person" key="xx">Surgeon Charles Bower</name>, <name
      type="organization" key="437">6th Pennsylvania Reserves</name>. The patient was sent to
     <name type="place" key="#Washington">Washington</name>, and admitted, on <date type="admit" when="1864-07-16">July 16th</date>, to <name
      type="hospital" key="176">Lincoln Hospital</name>. He was in an exhausted condition and had no
     appetite. He utterly refused to take bark or stimulants of any description. The tongue and
     fauces were covered with aphth&#230;. There was diarrh&#339;a, from which, in a chronic form,
     the patient had long suffered. He died on <date type="death" when="1864-07-27">July 27,
      1864</date>. There was extreme emaciation. At the autopsy but slight lesions were found in the
     viscera, except the great intestine, which was studded with ulcers. The necrosed extremity of
     the femur slightly protruded from the wound. This was the end of a very large, loose
     sequestrum, invested by a fragile involucrum. The specimen in the <name type="hospital"
      key="431">Army Medical Museum</name>, No. 2890, <hi rend="italic">Surgical Section</hi>,
     consists of the stump of the right femur, with a very large sequestrum in process of separation
     and a partial involucrum formed.</p>
