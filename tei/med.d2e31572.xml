He suffered intense pain, which was but slightly relieved by anodynes, and died, in great agony, on <date type="death" when="1863-05-05">the 5th</date>.  At the autopsy, it was observed that considerable inflammatory action had taken place; the bowels were agglutinated together, and there was a thick deposit of yellowish lymph. The small intestine was perforated in two places (<hi rend="initialcap">F</hi>IG. <sic>45</sic><corr>46</corr>), and from the openings, which were large and ragged, a number of lumbricoid worms had crawled into the cavity of the abdomen. F&#230;cal matter, also, had been extravasated.
