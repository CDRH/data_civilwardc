Chronic diarrh&#339;a.  This man had been sick about four weeks and was greatly emaciated. His pulse was feeble and irregular; tongue dry; dejections frequent and bloody. He complained of pain and tenderness along the track of the colon. There was no tympanites.  Died, <date type="death" when="1863-08-26">August 26th</date>.  <hi rend="italic">Autopsy:</hi> Body much emaciated. Heart and lungs healthy. The liver weighed seventy-one ounces; the gall-bladder was much distended with bile. The spleen healthy, weight nine ounces. The stomach was somewhat injected. The duodenum, jejunum, and upper part of the ileum healthy; the lower part of the ileum was very much injected twelve well-marked old ulcers were counted within a foot of the ileoc&#230;cal valve. The colon was much ulcerated, especially in the sigmoid flexure. The kidneys were healthy.&#8212;<name type="person" key="184">Acting Assistant Surgeon Lloyd Dorsey</name>.  [Nos. 151 and 152, Medical Section, <name type="hospital" key="431">Army Medical Museum</name>, are from this case. The specimens are successive portions of the somewhat thickened colon. In the lower part of No. 151 there is an irregular ulcer, six lines in long diameter, which penetrates to the muscular coat. No. 152 presents a number of larger ulcers of similar character. These ulcers have apparently resulted from the separation of diphtheritic sloughs.]</p>
