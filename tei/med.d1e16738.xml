                                                  incision was made by <name type="person">Acting Assistant Surgeon W. P. Moon</name>, and the bone exposed, when the slightest
                                                  perceptible fissure in the external table was
                                                  discovered, from which a thin sanious discharge
                                                  was issuing. Upon removing a portion of the two
                                                  tables with a trephine, it was ascertained that
                                                  the fissure extended through both tables, without
                                                  fracturing or depressing either. Quite an amount
                                                  of pus escaped from the orifice and considerable
                                                  disorganization was evident.  Death occurred on <date type="death" when="1865-05-25">May 25th, 1865</date>.  At the autopsy, the interior lobes
                                                  were found greatly congested, with formation of
                                                  pus over a great extent of the longitudinal sinus.
