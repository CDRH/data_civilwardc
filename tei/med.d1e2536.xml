                                        and somewhat injected eyes, congestion of the face, a full
                                        strong pulse beating 90 per minute, a hot skin showing a few
                                        rose-spots on the chest and abdomen, a dry, fissured and
                                        brown-crusted tongue, sordes on the lips and teeth,
                                        anorexia, thirst and some tympanites. Beef-essence, quinine
                                        and turpentine emulsion were prescribed. No change took
                                        place until November 2, when the skin was bathed in
                                        perspiration and some deafness was noted. Delirium set in on
                                        the 3d, on which day the patient had three stools. The
                                        tongue seemed cleaning on the 7th and the delirium lessened,
                                        but the condition otherwise was as related. On the 9th,
                                        after passing a better night than usual, he showed a return
                                        of appetite. Next day he was intelligent. On the 11th the
                                        tongue was red at the tip and edges, dry and brown in the
                                        centre and the skin was hot, but the patient slept well, had
                                        a good appetite, and his bowels were quiet. The record gives
                                        no further details. He was transferred to <name type="place">Baltimore, Md.</name>, on
