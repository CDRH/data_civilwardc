        F——</name>, <name type="organization">Co. F, 18th Massachusetts
          Volunteers</name>, aged 30 years, was wounded at <name type="BATTLE">Bull Run</name>,
          <date type="injury" when="1862-08-30">August 30, 1862</date>, and was admitted to hospital
        at <name type="place">Alexandria</name>, on <date type="admit" when="1862-08-31">the
          following day</date>. There was a wound of the left arm, about four inches below the
        acromion process , to which cold water was applied. On <date type="operation" when="1862-09-03">the 3d</date>, and again on <date type="operation" when="1862-09-05">the
          5th</date> of September, fragments of the ball, with a few pieces of comminuted bone, were
        removed through an incision on the outer edge of the scapula, affording the patient
        considerable relief. A profuse discharge from the wound soon followed, and on <date type="injury" when="1862-09-19">the 19th</date>, symptoms of purulent infection set in. An
        active treatment by stimulants, quinia, iron, and ammonia, was instituted, but unavailingly.
        Death resulted on <date type="death" when="1862-09-25">September 25th</date>. The necropsy
        showed a fracture of the head and dorsum of the scapula, extending below and parallel to its
        spine. A large collection of extravasated blood was found beneath the scapula and between
        the muscles of the shoulder, which were disorganized, and of a greenish hue. There was
        extensive serous effusion in the left pleural cavity, and numerous metastatic foci in both
        lungs. The fractured scapula, with two fragments of ball attached, and having upon its
        venter a thin layer of friable, yellowish exudation, was contributed to the <name type="hospital" key="431">Army Medical Museum</name> by <name type="person">Acting
          Assistant Surgeon W. H. Butler</name>, and is figured in the adjoining wood-cut (<hi rend="initialcap">F</hi>IG. 213).</p>
