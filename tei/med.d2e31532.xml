E, 19th Veteran Reserve Corps</name>, was shot, at <name type="hospital" key="115">Sherburne Barracks</name>, <date type="injury" when="1864-04-15">April 15, 1864</date>, while resisting a sentinel.  The charge entered posteriorly, between the eleventh and twelfth ribs, and emerged anteriorly, between the ninth and tenth. There was collapse from internal h&#230;morrhage, and the patient died <date type="death" when="1864-04-16">in eleven hours from the reception of the injury</date>. Cold external applications and free internal stimulation constituted the treatment.  At the autopsy, the great lobe of the liver was found much torn, a large piece being separated; the right kidney was severed, and a portion of the transverse colon was torn away. The abdominal cavity was completely filled with blood. The specimen, with notes of the case, were contributed by <name type="person" key="1023">Acting Assistant Surgeon Daniel Weisel</name>, and has been already noted and figured in the <hi rend="italic">Catalogue of the Surgical Section of the <name type="hospital" key="431">Army Medical Museum</name></hi>, 1865, page 487.</p>
