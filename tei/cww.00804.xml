                        was given to your petitioner that her said father died in said <placeName>

                        as may enhance the same, and also such facts, if any, touching the moral,
                        mental, and bodily infirmities or defects of said person, as impair the

                        such service or labor, and that he believes none other to exist. If the
                        petitioner specify no such infirmity or defect, then his statement touching
                        the value of his claim should conclude with an averment that he has no

                        but which does not impair her value, and of excellent moral character of
                        sound mind &amp; that your petitioner knows of no defect or bodily other

                    the present rebellion, nor in any way given aid or comfort thereto.</p>

                <p>And your petitioner further states and alleges, that <seg type="handwritten">she</seg> has not brought said <seg type="handwritten">
                        <persName>Maria Snodon</persName>
                   </seg> into the District of Columbia since the passage of said act of Congress;
                    and that, at the time of the passage thereof, said <seg type="handwritten">
                        <persName>Maria</persName>
                   </seg> was held to service or labor therein under and by virtue of your
                    petitioner's claim to such service or labor.</p>

                <p>Your petitioner further states and alleges, that <seg type="handwritten">she</seg> said claim to the service or labor of said <seg type="handwritten">
                        <persName>Maria Snodon</persName>

                    person who has in any manner aided or sustained the present rebellion against
                    the Government of the United States.</p>

                <p>And your petitioner prays the said Commissioners to investigate and determine the
                    validity of <seg type="handwritten">her</seg> said claim to the service or labor
                    of said <space atLeast="1"/> herein above set forth; and if the same be found to be valid, that they
                    appraise and apportion the value of said claim in money, and report the same to
                    the Secretary of the Treasury of the United States, in conformity to the
                    provisions of said act of Congress.</p>
