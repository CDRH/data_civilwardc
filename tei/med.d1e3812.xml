                                        with headache, constipation, pains in the bones and a chill
                                        and fever, for which quinine was administered. On the day
                                        after admission he was restless and had an anxious
                                        expression; he perspired during sleep, but when awake his
                                        skin was hot and dry; pulse 74; tongue pale but red at the
                                        tip and edges; four thin stools had been passed during the
                                        twenty-four hours, and there was slight pain, chiefly
                                        umbilical and during micturition; he had also a stitch in
                                        the side and some pain in the breast. Quinine was given. In
                                        the evening the pulse was 78, the skin hot but sweating and
                                        the tongue pale, flabby and somewhat brown; four stools were
                                        passed during the day. Acetate of lead and opium were
                                        prescribed. Next morning the pulse had fallen to 56 and the
                                        patient was sweating profusely. In the evening there was a
                                        slight accession of fever; only one stool was passed during
                                        the twenty-four hours. For some days after this the
                                        perspiration continued profuse, especially at night,
                                        although aromatic sulphuric acid was administered; the
                                        bowels remained quiet and the tongue flabby and coated gray
                                        or brown at the base. Blue-pill was given three times on the
                                        15th, and in the evening of the 16th ten grains of calomel,
                                        which produced three painful stools, but the bowels
                                        thereafter became again quiet although tender especially in
                                        the right iliac region. The perspirations continued. Morphia
                                        was given at night and the patient was sponged with alcohol.
                                        On the 18th some pustules appeared on the abdomen. Next day
                                        he is reported as looking stout and healthy, with bright
                                        eyes and clear mind, although there was some headache and
                                        pain in the back and breast, with a slight gray coating on
                                        the tongue. Three grains of calomel and a half grain of
                                        opium were given three times. The record concludes on 
                                        <date when="1861-09-21">the 21st</date>, the
