                    ball which fractured the outer table of the frontal bone at its superior portion
                    and to the left of the median line.  He was stunned, but after reaction,
                    endeavored to walk, but was too faint and giddy to go far. With the assistance
                    of two comrades he retired to a field hospital where cold water was applied to
                    the wound.  He was transferred to <name type="place">Frederick</name>, and thence to <name type="place" key="#Washington">Washington</name>, entering

                    <date type="operation" when="1862-10-26">October 26th</date> two pieces of the outer table of the frontal bone were removed. At
                    times he suffered severe pain over his eyebrows which extended over the left
                    side of his head, and occasionally he was so dizzy that he could not walk across
                    the ward.  He was discharged from the service on <date type="servicedischarge"
