     Dullahan</name>, <name type="organization" key="510">Co. D, 3d Vermont</name>, aged 24 years,
    was wounded in the right ankle, at <name type="BATTLE" key="12">the Wilderness</name>, <date
     type="injury" when="1864-05-05">May 5, 1864</date>. <date type="admit" when="1864-05-11">Six
     days after receiving the injury</date> he was admitted to <name type="hospital" key="173"
     >Harewood Hospital</name>, Washington, and <date type="transfer" when="1864-05-18">one week
     later</date> the man was transferred to <name type="hospital" key="xx">South Street Hospital,
     Philadelphia</name>. <name type="person" key="xx">Surgeon S. J. W. Mintzer</name>, <name
     type="organization" key="132">U. S. V.</name>, in charge of the latter hospital, recorded a
    wound of the ankle with compound fracture of the inner malleolus by a mini&#233; ball, which
    entered at the inner malleolus and came out just behind the external malleolus. Cold-water
    dressings were used. On May 23d there was great pain and swelling, and an application of lead
    water and laudanum was kept wrapped around the limb; morphia, milk punch, and beef essence being
    administered. <date type="operation" when="1864-05-25">Two days afterwards</date> the wounds of
    exit and entrance were enlarged, after which the foot was again wrapped up in the same
    application. On May 27th, the pain still continuing, equal parts of tincture of aconite and
    water were applied, and two days later a plaster of extract of hemlock was made to cover the
    entire foot. On May 30th quinine pills were prescribed, and another lotion consisting of
    laudanum and tincture of aconite was ordered to be constantly applied. The entries in the
    hospital records at this date mention that the patient was evidently sinking. He subsequently
    mended, however, and became well enough to be transferred to <name type="place" key="xx"
     >Brattleboro</name> on <date type="transfer" when="1864-06-29">June 29th</date>. Several months
    later he was transferred to <name type="place" key="xx">Burlington</name>, where he was assigned
    to the <name type="organization" key="109">Veteran Reserve Corps</name> February 21, 1865. The
    patient was ultimately discharged from service at Sloan Hospital, <name type="place" key="xx"
     >Montpelier</name>, <date type="servicedischarge" when="1865-07-25">July 25,1865</date>, and
    pensioned. <name type="person" key="1245">Surgeon H. Janes</name>, <name type="organization"
     key="132">U. S. V.</name>, in charge of the latter, contributed the photograph represented in
    the adjacent cut (<hi rend="initialcap">F</hi>IG. 330), and reported that, according to the
    patient's statement, the lower end of the tibia became necrosed and was gouged out twice at
     <name type="place" key="xx">Brattleboro</name> Hospital. At the time of the man's discharge his
    general health was good and the wound was nearly healed, with ligamentous anchylosis of the
    joint and very slight contraction of the muscles of the calf of the leg. There was no appearance
    of caries or necrosis, and he could walk a short distance with a cane, gaining some motion of
    the joint by exercise. <name type="person" key="xx">Examiner A. L. Lowell</name>, of <name
     type="place">Burlington, Vermont</name>, certified, <date type="pension" when="1870-03-26"
     >March 26, 1870</date>: "The cicatrix of entrance is adherent to the bone and healthy, but
    sensitive to pressure. The inner malleolus is considerably thickened by bony deposit and the new
    growth is operative in limiting the motions of the foot. The tibio-tarsal articulation is
    obstructed in its function by false anchylosis. In flexion and extension of the foot the toes
    describe an arc of but two inches. The foot is inverted to such a degree as to throw the weight
    of the body on the outer margin of the sole." The pensioner was paid <date type="pension"
