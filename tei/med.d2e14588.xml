    condyle of the femur, passed inward and upward, and, escaping posteriorly in the middle of the
    lower third of thigh, left the bone much comminuted at its exit. He was admitted to the hospital
    of the 1st division, Ninth Corps, where, on <date type="admit" when="1862-12-16">December

    femur, however, was fractured half an inch above this point, and fissures extended two inches
    further. The operation was well borne, and the case continued to do well until the sixth day,
    when sloughing commenced; on the eighth, signs of gangrene were noticed; and, on the ninth,
