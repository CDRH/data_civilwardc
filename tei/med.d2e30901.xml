M. Dean</name> reported: &#34;Compound comminuted fracture of right radius in its middle third by a mini&#233; ball.  May 11th, resected some four inches of the shaft of the radius. In the operation the interosseous artery was wounded high up, and, owing to the close proximity of the elbow joint, could not be got at to tie. The forceps was therefore left on it to control the h&#230;morrhage, which it did very effectually.  15th, a large abscess has formed, which, although opened freely, is connected by a sinus from the wrist to the elbow. 17th, had h&#230;morrhage from the wound about noon; forceps still in the wound.  18th, had h&#230;morrhage at four o'clock P. M., and again at five and a half o'clock P. M., which was very persistent. Amputation of the arm in the lower third was agreed upon, and performed <date type="operation" when="1863-05-18">the same afternoon</date>, by antero-posterior skin flaps, by <name type="person" key="131">Surgeon H.

June 1st, still continues to recover.&#34; The excised portion of the radius is represented in the adjacent wood-cut (<hi rend="initialcap">F</hi>IG. 695), two flattened pieces of lead, as though a distorted ball and a buckshot, being mounted with the specimen.
