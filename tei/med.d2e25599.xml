     type="organization" key="502">69th Pennsylvania</name>, aged 49 years, had both his feet

    of <name type="hospital" key="173">Harewood Hospital</name>, Washington, gives the following
    history: "The patient was a man of temperate habits and of good constitution. The tent in which
    he was sleeping in the field was blown down during the night, when his feet became exposed, the
    other parts of his body remaining well protected. Although the weather was intensely cold, he
    slept well during the night, and on waking up in the morning found the forepart of both his feet
    frozen. He received no treatment until admitted to <name type="hospital" key="173">this
     hospital</name> on <date type="admit" when="1864-02-01">February 1st</date>. At the time of his
    admission the patient was found to be suffering from dry gangrene of the toes of both feet,
    resulting from the freezing, and extending to the metatarsal bones of the left foot, with
    destruction of the soft parts. The patient was in good spirits, and although he was doing well
    it was deemed advisable to disarticulate the toes. Nourishing diet and stimulants were
    administered and simple dressings were used." The amputated toes, contributed to <name
     type="hospital" key="431">the Museum</name> with the description of the case by <name
     type="person" key="158">Surgeon Bontecou</name>, constitute specimen 2163 of the <hi
     rend="italic">Surgical Section</hi>, and a representation of the diseased feet appears in the
    adjoining wood-cut (<hi rend="initialcap">F</hi>IG. 372). The patient was discharged from
    service for disability <date type="servicedischarge" when="1865-01-27">January 27, 1865</date>,
    and pensioned. The <name type="organization" key="xx">Philadelphia Examining Board</name> on
     <date type="pension" when="1877-11-07">November 7, 1877</date>, certified to the pensioner's
    condition as follows: "He has had all the toes of the right foot amputated through the
    metatarso-phalangeal articulation except the little toe, which is drawn into the cicatrix. The
    foot is defective in circulation and there are chronic ulcers of the leg extending from the
    ankle to within four and a half inches below the knee, being very offensive and requiring
    constant care and attention. This condition no doubt is due to an&#230;sthesia of the foot and
    leg. The cicatrices extend around the leg and are constantly sealing. There is also varix above
    to a slight extent. The toes of the left foot were amputated at the tarso-metatarsal
    articulation, the stump showing a good horny cicatrix; hyper&#230;sthesia of foot or stump;
    atrophy of leg; stump alleged to be painful during changes of weather," etc. The pensioner was
    paid <date type="pension" when="1881-09-04">September 4, 1881</date>.</p>
