                                        and enjoyed excellent health up to <date type="injury" when="1863-03">fourteen months ago</date>, when
                                        he was seized with a cold while on a scout at <name type="place">Winchester,
                                                Va.</name>, which in a few days was followed by fever. This
                                        confined him to bed for six or seven weeks, after which he
                                        partially recovered and went home on furlough, where he had
                                        a relapse which disabled him for four or five weeks. He so
                                        far recovered from this as to be able to walk several miles
                                        and continued to improve for two months, when he was taken
                                        with dysentery, which lasted two or three weeks, and since
                                        that time he has not fully regained his strength. He
                                        returned to his regiment and remained with it for about four
                                        weeks while it was in camp at <name type="place">Brandy Station, Va.</name>, but
                                        during that time he was unfit for duty. When the army moved
                                        he was sent to <name type="hospital" key="xxx">hospital at Alexandria</name>, where he remained a
                                        month, after which he was transferred, as above stated. When
                                        admitted he was suffering from debility consequent on
                                        typhoid fever and dysentery. He was put on tonics and
                                        astringents, with the best diet the hospital afforded. He
                                        improved gradually until the 14th, when he complained of a
                                        sharp pain in the lower part of the right breast, aggravated
                                        by deep inspiration and coughing; pulse 120 and small;
                                        tongue moist and red; cough with white frothy
                                        expectoration; decubitus on left side; skin very hot. This
                                        pleuritic attack lasted until the 25th, after which
                                        convalescence progressed satisfactorily until July 11, when
                                        he complained of diarrh&#339;a with some tenesmus, which
                                        steadily increased, resisting all efforts for its relief. He
                                        died <date type="death" when="1864-07-25">July 25th</date>.

                                        sixteen hours after death: Body much emaciated. A large
                                        amount of serum was found beneath the dura mater, between
                                        the layers of the arachnoid and in the ventricles: the
                                        substance of the brain was soft. The right pleural cavity
                                        was filled with purulent serum and the pulmouary and costal
                                        pleura were completely lined with a fibro-albuminous
                                        deposit; the lung was consolidated by pressure and bound to
                                        the posterior wall of the chest; both lungs were
                                        tuberculous; one tubercular ulcer in the right lung had
                                        perforated the pulmonary pleura. Tubercles were diffused
                                        over the surface of the heart and pericardium. The liver was
                                        healthy; spleen small and hard; kidneys small in size but
                                        healthy in appearance. Ulcers, with their long diameters at
                                        right angles to the length of the gut, were found throughout
                                        the small intestine.&#8212;<hi rend="italic"><name type="person">Act. Ass't
