        72 and <hi rend="initialcap">F</hi>IG. 73,) consists of the body of the frontal bone, with a
        fragment of lead impacted near the centre and to the left of the median line. An ovoid plate
        of the external table, measuring one by two inches, is slightly discolored, and surrounded
        by a groove of demarcation, external to which the bone is cribriform. A plate of the inner
        table, measuring one square inch, is detached by three of its sides, and driven inward to
        the depth of two lines at its free edges. Two fissures, each one and a fourth inches in
        length, run backward and outward, and there is a slight deposit of new osseous material on
        the inner surface. The specimen was contributed by <name type="person" key="323">Surgeon T.
