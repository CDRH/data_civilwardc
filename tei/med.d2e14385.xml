     Rist</name>, <name type="organization" key="460">Co. A, 36th Wisconsin</name>, aged 18 years,
    was wounded at <name type="BATTLE" key="16">Cold Harbor</name>, <date type="injury"
     when="1864-06-01">June 1, 1864</date>, by a conoidal ball, which entered on the inner and
    posterior portion of the left leg and caused a fracture of the tibia, which extended into the
    knee joint. He was <date type="admit" when="1864-06-01">immediately</date> conveyed to the field
    hospital of the 2d division, Second Corps, where amputation at the knee joint was performed by
     <name type="person" key="xx">Surgeon J. M. Burr</name>, <name type="organization" key="461">42d
     New York</name>. On <date type="transfer" when="1864-06-11">June 11th</date>, he was admitted
    into <name type="hospital" key="176">Lincoln Hospital</name>, Washington, where <name
     type="person" key="1110">Acting Assistant Surgeon C. H. Bowen</name> reported: "Date of
    operation, <date type="operation" when="1864-06-03">June 3d</date>; amputation at knee joint,
    leaving patella and condyles of femur." Dr. Bowen adds: "Having seen several of these operations
    performed, they have all died in periods varying from six to twenty days, from py&#230;mia,
    tetanus, etc., I totally discard the operation: 1st, from the extensive suppuration from the
    condyles of the femur and from the patella, from the duration of the suppuration, which will
    continue until the entire cartilaginous substance from condyles and patella is either cut away
    or has sloughed off by the work of nature, after which comes the continuous discharge of the
    synovial fluid from the wound. In the case of <name type="person" key="1109">Rist</name>, in
    which the limb was amputated on <date type="operation" when="1864-06-03">June 3, 1864</date>,
    the synovia still exudes, in December, 1864, in quantities varying from a teaspoonful to a
    tablespoonful, and more especially, after the least exertion, such as walking by means of
    crutches; besides, the cicatrix is of a sloughing character, tending to gangrene. December 14th,
    amputation not healed; continuous discharge of synovial fluid, more especially when walking;
    tendency to slough; patient otherwise in a healthy condition, and desires a re-amputation, and,
    in my opinion, the stump will never heal while remaining in its present condition." On <date
     type="operation" when="1864-12-15">December 15, 1864</date>, <name type="person" key="243"
     >Assistant Surgeon J. C. McKee</name>, <name type="organization" key="190">U. S. A.</name>,
    amputated the thigh at the lower third; skin flap and circular section of muscles. Simple
    dressings were applied. The patient recovered rapidly. He was transferred to Harvey Hospital,
     <name type="place">Madison, Wisconsin</name>, on <date type="transfer" when="1865-03-23">March
     23d</date>, and discharged from service <date type="servicedischarge" when="1865-05-20">May 20,
     1865</date>. His pension was paid <date type="pension" when="1879-03-04">March 4, 1879</date>.
     <name type="person" key="243">Dr. McKee</name> contributed a photograph of the patient (<hi
