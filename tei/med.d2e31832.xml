There was one firm and unyielding stricture in the spongy portion of the urethra, and another one, less tense, in the membranous portion; there was no discharge from the urethra; there was incontinence of urine.  On <date type="operation" when="1866-06-05">June 5th</date>, <name type="person" key="xxx">Acting Assistant Surgeon G. P. Hanawalt</name> commenced dilating the stricture by means of silver sounds, introduced twice daily, no anæsthetic being used. The patient's constitutional condition was good at the time, and there was but little sensibility of the urethra, which had been already treated by <name type="person" key="xxx">Dr. R. K. Stone</name> with Holt's dilator. In the evening, a No. 1 sound was introduced with slight difficulty. On <date type="operation" when="1866-06-06">the following day</date>, a No. 2 sound was carried into the bladder, and a No. 3 into the first stricture. On <date type="operation" when="1866-06-07">the 7th</date>, the No. 3 was passed into the bladder. On the 10th and 11th, there was traumatic urethritis from too frequent catheterism. He left hospital on the 12th, but returned on the 20th, and was discharged from hospital <date type="hospitaldischarge" when="1866-06-25">June 25, 1866</date>, his treatment being continued as an out-door patient. On <date type="operation" when="1866-06-27">the 27th</date>, the next to the largest sound was introduced. On <date type="operation" when="1866-07-03">July 3d</date>, the patient himself introduced a large-sized bougie without difficulty.  He was cured in twenty-eight days, urinating in a full stream."</p>
