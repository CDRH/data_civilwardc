      Denniston</name>, <name type="organization" key="784">Commissary of Subsistence</name>, <name type="organization" key="132">U. S. V.</name>, aged 24 years, was wounded in the right
     foot, during the engagement at the <name type="BATTLE" key="90">Weldon Railroad</name>, <date type="injury" when="1864-08-25">August 25, 1864</date>. <name type="person" key="xx">Surgeon
      N. Hayward</name>, <name type="organization" key="481">20th Massachusetts</name>, reported his
     admission to the field hospital of the 2d division, Second Corps, with "fracture of ankle," followed by "Pirogoff's operation, performed by <name type="person" key="xx">Surgeon G. Chaddock</name>,
      <name type="organization" key="524">7th Michigan</name>."  <name type="person" key="123">Surgeon D. W. Bliss</name>, <name type="organization" key="132">U. S. V.</name>, who
     subsequently re-amputated the limb, reported that "the patient entered <name type="hospital" key="171">Armory Square Hospital</name>, Washington, <date type="transfer" when="1864-08-28">August 28th</date>. On September 6th hæmorrhage ensued, which was controlled by styptics
     and a compress, but commenced again two days afterwards, when the femoral was held by the
     attendants for several hours. On <date type="operation" when="1864-09-10">September 10th</date> a fresh and copious hæmorrhage set in,
     when, after a thorough examination of the parts, it was deemed proper to amputate at a point
     about three inches above the ankle, the patient being in good condition at the time. The entire
     loss of blood probably amounted to a pint, its source being first the anterior tibial and
     afterwards the femoral artery. The amputation was performed by the circular method and without
     much shock to the patient's system. The treatment included tonics, stimulants, and nourishing
     diet. Simple dressings were used. Three weeks after the operation the patient was doing well."
     The re-amputated stump, showing the soft tissues and the cut surfaces of the tibia and os
     calcis softened by suppuration, was forwarded to <name type="hospital" key="431">the Museum</name> by <name type="person" key="123">the operator</name> and constitutes specimen 3211 of the <hi rend="italic">Surgical
      Section</hi>.  In 1881 the soft tissues were removed from the specimen, when it was found that
     the tibia was fissured to the extent of four inches (<hi rend="initialcap">F</hi>IG. 348). The
     patient was subsequently transferred to the <name type="hospital" key="156">Seminary Hospital</name>, Georgetown, where he obtained leave of absence <date type="furlough" when="1867-01-01">November 25th</date>l, when he started for his home. He was ultimately mustered out of service <date type="servicedischarge" when="1867-01-01">January 1, 1867</date>, and pensioned.  While serving as an officer of the <name type="organization" key="525">70th New York</name>, at the battle of <name type="battle" key="126">Williamsburg</name>, <date type="injury" when="1862-05-05">May 5, 1862</date>, <name type="person" key="1387">Captain Denniston</name> had also been wounded in the right forearm, for which
     injury he underwent the operation of resection of the continuity of the bones.²  After leaving the service he obtained an artificial leg from the <name type="organization" key="xx">Pittsburgh Artificial Limb Manufacturing Co.</name>, and since then he has continued to report the stump of his amputated leg as being in a "healthy condition." The pensioner was paid <date type="pension" when="1881-09-04">September 4, 1881</date>.</p>
