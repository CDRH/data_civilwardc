                                                  healed; there was a purulent discharge from the
                                                  right nostril, and a fissure in the anterior part
                                                  of the superior maxilla, the length of which could
                                                  not be satisfactorily ascertained. A probe was
                                                  readily passed into the antrum. <name type="person" key="459">Assistant Surgeon George A. Mursick</name>, <name type="organization" key="132">U. S. V.</name>, made an incision from
                                                  the angle of the mouth to the lower edge of the
                                                  malar bone, turned up the flap of the cheek,
                                                  applied a large trephine over the antrum, removed
                                                  a button of bone, and extracted the ball, which
                                                  was found lying loose in the antrum. The patient's
                                                  constitutional condition was good. On <date type="injury" when="1864-05-24">May 24th</date>, he
                                                  had some fever and swelling of the cheek. On May
                                                  25th, the swelling of the face had increased and
                                                  was erysipelatous in character. On May 27th, the
                                                  swelling having nearly subsided, the sutures were
                                                  removed. The lower half of the incision had united
                                                  by first intention; the remainder was suppurating;
                                                  the discharge from the nostril had diminished, and
                                                  the patient was doing well. On <date type="injury" when="1864-08-01">August 1st</date>, the
                                                  wound had not healed; there was an opening over
                                                  where the bone was trephined. Some small pieces of
                                                  bone were discharged, both from the wound of
                                                  operation and the nostril. The patient was able to
                                                  chew his food well. On <date type="servicedischarge" when="1864-09-03">September 3d, 1864</date>, his
                                                  term of enlistment having expired, he was
                                                  discharged the service. The wound of operation had not
                                                  entirely healed; a small sinus was leading to the
                                                  antrum, the orifice of which was surrounded by
                                                  pouting granulations, and a small piece of
                                                  necrosed bone could be felt at the bottom. The
                                                  cicatrix was rather large, but there was no other
                                                  deformity. The specimen is No. 3374, Sect. II, A. M. M., showing the disk of bone removed from the
                                                  superior maxilla, with the battered and flattened
                                                  ball. The specimen and history were contributed by
                                                  the operator. On <date type="pension">March 8th, 1865</date>, <name type="person">Pension Examiner G. S. McCook</name> reports that the jaw is exfoliating,
