                                        sick for several weeks with typhoid fever. He had some
                                        diarrh&#339;a and cough on admission, but the
                                        respiration was natural. On the evening of November 4 the
                                        respiration became increased to 26, the tongue dry, the
                                        pulse accelerated, and crepitation was detected in the lower
                                        part of the right lung. The sputa became streaked with blood
                                        on the 5th and rusty on the 6th. On the 9th the patient was
                                        very weak and swallowed with difficulty; he was scarcely
                                        able to expectorate; he slept with his eyes half open and
                                        was unable to speak. He was stronger on the 11th and his
                                        bowels were quiet, but the right side of the body was
                                        paralyzed. On the 12th he was much stronger and asked for
                                        food; his countenance was bright, tongue nearly clean and
                                        bowels regular. He gradually rallied from this low condition
                                        but the paralysis continued. Strychnia was given on December
                                        1. On Jan. 1, 1862, he was able to walk with a cane;
                                        sensation in the arm was much improved but motion was
                                        impossible. He was discharged for disability on <date
