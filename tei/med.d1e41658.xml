There was <choice><orig>dulness</orig><reg>dullness</reg></choice> on percussion over the whole of the right lung.  Treatment: Astringents, expectorants, cod-liver oil, stimulants and a nutritious diet.  The diarrhœa was readily controlled, but the chest-symptoms were persistent.  Died, <date type="death" when="1864-11-13">November 13th</date>.  <hi rend="italic">Autopsy</hi> <date type="autopsy" when="1864-11-14">eighteen hours after death</date>: Body moderately rigid and much emaciated; several nævi materni were observed on the right hip. The right lung was infiltrated with miliary tubercles, and had several cavities in its upper lobe; the left lung was also tuberculous, but less diseased than the right; its upper lobe was adherent to the parietes of the chest. The mucous membrane of the trachea was ulcerated. The heart was small but normal; there was a small clot in the left ventricle; the large veins and arteries were nearly empty. The liver was enlarged; the gall-bladder empty. The spleen enlarged and filled with black blood. The mesenteric glands were cheesy. The small intestine was ulcerated in several places, in others presented distinct pustules; [?] three distinct intussusceptions of the small intestine were observed. The large intestine was congested and presented a number of ulcers. The kidneys were enlarged; the urinary bladder contained eight ounces of light-colored urine.</p>
   <p>⃰ It is to be regretted that, in most instances, the records of this hospital do not show by whom the autopsies were made. It is known that many of them were made by <name type="person" key="134">Surgeon Bentley</name> himself, or under his immediate supervision, but it is only possible to distinguish these from the others in a few cases.</p>
