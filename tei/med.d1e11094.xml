                                        portion and purplish towards the bifurcation. The right lung
                                        weighed twenty-two ounces and a half; the whole of its lower
                                        lobe and the posterior portions of the other lobes were
                                        solidified and contained circumscribed collections of pus;
                                        the middle and lower lobes were interadherent and coated
                                        with yellowish lymph. The left lung weighed eighteen ounces;
                                        its lower lobe was affected like that on the opposite side,
                                        but it was less firmly solidified and contained fewer pus
                                        deposits; the left pleural sac contained sixteen ounces of
                                        pus. Two ounces of liquid were found in the pericardium;
                                        venous clots and uncoagulated blood in the right cavities of
                                        the heart, and a small clot in the left side. The liver
                                        weighed fifty-eight ounces; the spleen, nineteen ounces,
                                        was extremely soft; the pancreas and kidneys normal. Some
                                        regions of hyper&#230;mia were observed in the small intestine,
                                        but the large intestine was healthy.&#8212;<hi rend="italic"><name type="person" key="245">Ass't Surgeon Harrison Allen</name>, <name type="organization" key="190">U.
