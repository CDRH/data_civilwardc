                                        as a case of remittent fever. On <date type="injury" when="1861-10-08">October 8</date> he had chills and
                                        fever which continued a week, with weakness, anorexia,
                                        nausea and vomiting, and during this period he felt better
                                        in the morning than in the evening. He was treated with
                                        quinine, rhubarb and capsicum. On admission his cheeks were
                                        slightly flushed, countenance calm, eyes bright,
                                        conjunctivæ yellow, pulse 99, full and strong, skin
                                        yellow, warm, dry, soft and without eruption or sudamina,
                                        tongue moist, red at the tip and coated grayish in the
                                        centre, appetite deficient; the bowels were moved five
                                        times, and there was abdominal tenderness with slight
                                        gurgling but no meteorism. Calomel and full doses of quinine
                                        were prescribed. During the night the patient was delirious
                                        at times, and on the following day he had some deafness and
                                        tinnitus aurium. The quinine was continued and the calomel
                                        omitted. On November 1 the tongue was moist, pale and coated
                                        somewhat in the centre and at the base. Next day two
                                        rose-colored spots were noticed and sordes appeared on the
                                        teeth. Milk-punch, beef-essence and turpentine emulsion were
                                        prescribed. On the 4th the patient's condition was
                                        unchanged; he was very delirious, his face much flushed,
                                        pulse 98 and strong, skin very hot and showing some
                                        rose-colored spots, tongue dry in the centre but moist at
                                        the edges; he had no cough, but mucous and sibilant rales
                                        were heard in some parts of the chest; the bowels were moved
                                        by an enema of castor oil and turpentine and the tympanites
                                        which had been present was thereby reduced. He was dull and
                                        stupid on the 5th and had subsultus tendinum. Next day some
                                        petechial spots appeared. No further details are given. The
                                        patient was transferred to <name type="place">Annapolis, Md.</name>, on <date type="transfer" when="1861-11-18">the 18th</date>. </p>
