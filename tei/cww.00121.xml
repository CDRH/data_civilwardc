                        <persName>Henry A. Pumphrey</persName> of <placeName>Montgomery
                            County</placeName> instituted an action of trover
                        <!-- trover is a form of lawsuit--> in the Circuit Court for
                            <placeName>Prince Georges County</placeName>
                        <placeName>Maryland</placeName> against <persName>Martin Buell</persName> to
                        recover the value of a negro woman a slave for life of said
                            <persName>Pumphrey</persName> named <persName>Ann</persName> and after
                        several years of litigation both in the Circuit Court and in the Court of
                        Appeals <persName>Pumphrey</persName> finally succeeded in recovering
                        Judgement for the full value of said slave.</p>
                    <p>The said Judgement has been fully paid and satisfied by Mr
                            <persName>Buell</persName>, and my opinion is now asked, as to whom the
                        said slave <persName>Ann</persName> now belongs. The question is free of all
                        doubt or difficulty whatever.</p>
                    <p>The Courts of <placeName>New York</placeName>,
                            <placeName>Pennsylvania</placeName> and <placeName>Maryland</placeName>,
                        and I have no doubt of the English Common law on the subject, that a
                        recovery in trover, after satisfaction of the Judgement, transfers the title
                        in the property in dispute, to the defendant. It is equivalent to a legal
                        bargain and sale. The defendant having paid the Judgement while is supposed
                        to be for the full value, is entitled to the property itself, as owner.</p>
                    <p>It has been held by some of the Courts of law that a recovery in trover,
                        whether the Judgement <hi rend="underline">is paid</hi> or not, works a
                        transfer of title, but it is not necessary to moot this point of law as in
                        the present case, the defendant has in fact paid the Judgement.</p>
                    <p>I have no doubt therefore that negro <persName>Ann</persName> is now the
                        slave of <persName>Martin Buell</persName>. <pb xml:id="leaf002v"
