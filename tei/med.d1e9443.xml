                                        side. The right cavities of the heart were dilated and
                                        filled with fluid blood; their walls were thinned. The liver
                                        weighed sixty-four ounces; the spleen twelve ounces. The
                                        stomach and the upper part of the duodenum were much
                                        congested. The ileum was congested, especially in its lower
                                        part, which was thickened and inflamed and in Peyer's
                                        patches ulcerated; the ileo-c&#230;cal valve was much thickened and ulcerated.

                                        and hundreds of its solitary follicles were ulcerated; the
                                        rectum also was congested and softened. The kidneys were
