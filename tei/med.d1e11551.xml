                                        knocked down by the limb of a tree. He was stiff and sore
                                        for a few days after this, but continued to do duty until
                                        one morning, after a wet night on picket, his legs became
                                        paralysed and painful. He also had a sharp pain in the back
                                        and the feeling as if a cord were bound tightly around his

                                        the knees and on the outside of the feet, and this impairment was greater on the right than on the left side; there
                                        was tenderness on pressure over the vertebræ from the first dorsal to the last. Galvanism and tonics were employed.
