     <name type="organization" key="373">Co. B, 104th New York</name>, aged 26 years, was wounded at
     <name type="BATTLE" key="254">Petersburg</name>, <date type="injury" when="1864-06-22">June 22,
     1864</date>, and admitted to the field hospital of the 3d division, Fifth Corps. <name
     type="person" key="xx">Surgeon L. W. Read</name>, <name type="organization" key="132">U. S.
     V.</name>, noted, &#34;buckshot flesh wound of right leg, slight.&#34; On <date type="admit"
     when="1864-06-30">June 30th</date>, the patient entered the <name type="hospital" key="173"
     >Harewood Hospital</name>, Washington, whence <name type="person" key="158">Surgeon R. B.
     Bontecou</name>, <name type="organization" key="132">U. S. V.</name>, contributed the specimen
     (<hi rend="initialcap">F</hi>IG. 21), with the following brief history: &#34;Gunshot wound of
    right leg, middle third, injuring soft parts. On admission the constitutional state of the
    patient was very poor; condition of injured parts tolerably good, but wound very painful. The
    parts subsequently became gangrenous, with rapid sloughing of soft parts; about one half of the
    lower third, and three-fourths of the upper third, and all of the middle third of the tibia
    exposed and denuded of periosteum. The tibia became necrosed throughout its whole extent, and at
    this time the patient became jaundiced. On <date type="operation" when="1864-10-29">October
     29th</date>, about ten inches of necrosed bone was extracted by <name type="person" key="924"
     >Acting Assistant Surgeon D. I. Evans</name>. The general condition of the patient improved
    soon afterwards, under a supporting treatment throughout, and was doing tolerably well, parts
    improving, when transferred to hospital at <name type="place">Elmira</name>, <date
     type="transfer" when="1865-01-04">January 4, 1865</date>.&#34; <date type="furlough"
     when="1865-01-18">Two weeks after his transfer</date> the patient obtained a furlough and
    proceeded to his home in <name type="place">Tioga County, New York</name>, where his limb was
    subsequently amputated at the middle third of the thigh. <name type="person" key="xx">Dr. S.
     Knapp</name>, his attending physician, certified that &#34;he found him suffering from a badly
    cared for and neglected wound,&#34; etc., and that &#34;on <date type="operation"
     when="1865-02-28">February 28, 1865</date>, it became necessary to amputate the leg,&#34; which
    operation he performed, being assisted by <name type="person" key="xx">Dr. E. Daniels</name>.
    About <date type="admit" when="1865-05">two months afterwards</date> the patient returned to the
    hospital, and on <date type="servicedischarge" when="1865-07-21">July 21, 1865</date>, he was
    discharged from service and pensioned. He died <date type="death" when="1870-07-25">July 25,
     1870</date>, of consumption, resulting from the wound and its effects, more than five years
    after the amputation. The parts removed by the amputation at mid-thigh by <name type="person"
     key="xx">Dr. Knapp</name> were not transmitted to <name type="hospital" key="431">the
     Museum</name>; but the large sequestrum comprising the greater part of the diaphysis of the
    tibia is represented in the wood-cut (<hi rend="initialcap">F</hi>IG. 21), and, as mounted, is
    nine inches in length (see <hi rend="italic">Catalogue of the Surgical Section of the <name
