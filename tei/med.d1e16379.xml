                                                  urine involuntarily. At times there were lucid

                                                  convulsions recurred, and continued with increased
                                                  severity, until death occurred on <date type="death" when="1864-07-28">July 28th, 1864</date>.  The autopsy revealed extensive comminution of the
                                                  right parietal bone in the track of the ball,
                                                  which was six inches in length; the posterior
                                                  part of the right lobe of brain was protruding,
                                                  and in a state of disorganization; the anterior
                                                  portion was apparently healthy; the pericranium
                                                  was much thickened and congested.  The case is
                                                  reported by <name type="person" key="xx">Acting Assistant Surgeon T. L.
                                                                  Leavitt</name>.  The pathological specimen is No. 2905,
                                                  Sect. I, A. M. M., and was contributed by <name type="person" key="246">Acting Assistant Surgeon H. M. Dean</name>.  Between the wounds
                                                  of entrance and exit is a bridge of bone two and a
                                                  half inches wide. The edges of the fracture are
                                                  necrosed. The surrounding bone is porous, and
                                                  shows traces of the formation of a line of
