                                        hours after death</date>: The brain was firm and healthy. The
                                        trachea was of a dark-purple color, tinged with ochre on the
                                        rings; the bronchial tubes contained a dark grumous
                                        secretion. The &#339;sophagus was yellowish throughout.
                                        The lungs were somewhat &#339;dematous, the right
                                        weighing twenty ounces and the left twenty-one ounces. The
                                        heart was pushed upwards by the intestines; the right
                                        ventricle contained a fibrinous clot which extended some
                                        distance into the pulmonary artery; the left cavities
                                        contained a soft venous clot; the aorta was highly colored.
                                        The liver and stomach were concealed by the intestines; the
                                        liver was firm; the gall-bladder contained twelve drachms of
                                        dark-colored bile with a yellow flocculent deposit; the
                                        spleen was compact and of a dark-purple color; the pancreas
                                        was dark-green externally, hard and white internally. The
                                        intestines were much distended, evidently from cadaveric
                                        changes; the lower third of the small intestine was
                                        ulcerated in several places, in one of which there was a
                                        circular perforation with pale white edges, and the
                                        peritoneum surrounding it blackened to the extent of the
                                        Peyer's patch affected and covered with tough yellowish
                                        lymph for some distance beyond; the large intestine was
                                        healthy except that its solitary glands were conspicuous.
                                        The kidneys were dark-purple in color.&#8212;<hi
