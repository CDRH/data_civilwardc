            when="1861-10-19">Oct. 19, 1861</date>. He had previously suffered from rheumatism,

            14</date>, he was seized with a chill followed by fever and perspiration, wakefulness, thirst,
          diarrh&#339;a and pain in the bowels. His case on admission was diagnosed typhoid
          fever. On the 20th he was wakeful, his eyes dull, cheeks not flushed, pulse 66, full and
          strong, skin somewhat above the natural temperature, tongue red, slightly moist and with a
          few yellowish patches in the centre, appetite poor; he had six stools with some general
          abdominal tenderness and tympanites. A few rose-colored spots appeared next day, but
          otherwise his condition was unaltered. On the 22d he slept well; the pulse rose to 74 and
          was regular and strong; the skin was of the natural temperature; the tongue flabby and
          patched with a white fur; the appetite continued poor and the diarrh&#339;a active,
          the abdominal tenderness being more marked on the right side. After this the
          diarrh&#339;a gradually lessened, the tongue became clean and the appetite good. Up to
          the end of the month he was troubled with a slight cough with yellowish expectoration. He
          was returned to duty <date type="duty" when="1861-11-07">Nov. 7</date>. </p>
