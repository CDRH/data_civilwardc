                                                                battle of <name type="BATTLE" key="16">Cold Harbor, Virginia</name>, <date type="injury" when="1864-06-03">June 3d, 1864</date>, by a conoidal ball, which fractured and depressed the
                                                  posterior superior angle of the right parietal bone.  He was admitted to the field hospital, Eighteenth Corps, on <date type="admit" when="1864-06-03">the same day</date>; sent to <name type="hospital" key="201">St. Paul's Church Hospital</name>, <name type="place">Alexandria, Virginia</name>, on <date type="transfer" when="1864-06-08">the 8th</date>, and thence transferred to the Cuyler Hospital, <name type="place">Germantown, Pennsylvania</name>, on <date type="transfer" when="1864-06-13">the 13th</date>.  He suffered from headache without stupor or
                                                  delirium; partial paralysis of the left foot and
                                                  leg existed, and the tongue was drawn toward the
                                                  left side.  These symptoms continued without any

                                                  paralysis until the beginning of July, when
                                                  increased dullness and hebetude and a decided
                                                  icteroid tinge over the whole body, rendered the
                                                  prognosis more serious.  On <date type="operation" when="1864-07-02">July 2d</date>, the soft
                                                  parts were divided, the seat of fracture exposed
                                                  and all sequestra removed. One spicula measured an
                                                  inch in length by half an inch in width, involving
                                                  both tables. Considerable fetid pus flowed from
                                                  the wound. The dura mater was covered with healthy
                                                  granulations. The patient was kept in bed with his
                                                  head elevated; cold applications were made to the
                                                  wound, and an occasional mercurial and saline
                                                  cathartic was administered.  By <date type="injury" when="1864-09-30">September 30th</date>, the
                                                  wound had entirely healed. No cerebral symptoms
                                                  appeared during the treatment.
