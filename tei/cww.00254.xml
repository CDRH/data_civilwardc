                <head type="main">PETITION.</head>
                <p rend="bold">To the Commissioners under the act of Congress approved the <date when="1862-04-16">16th of April, 1862</date>, entitled "An act for the
                    release of certain persons held to service or labor in the District of
                    Columbia."</p>

                <p>Your Petitioner, <persName>William P. Trowbridge</persName> of the City of
                    <placeName>Washington D.C.</placeName> temporarily engaged in <placeName>New York</placeName> by this his petition in
                    writing, represents and states, that he is a person loyal to the <placeName>United States</placeName>,
                    who at the time of the passage of the said Act of Congress, held a claim to
                    service or labor against one person of African descent of the name of
                        <persName>Frank Ingersoll</persName> for and during the life of said person
                    and that by said act of Congress said person named <persName>Frank
                        Ingersoll</persName> was discharged and freed of and from all claim of your
                    petitioner to such service or labor; that at the time of said discharge said
                        <persName>Frank Ingersoll</persName> was of the age fourteen years and of
                    the following personal description: viz. In color he is <hi rend="underline">brown</hi>, not mulatto, he is
                    not very large for his age, but very bright and active</p>
                <p>That your petitioner acquired his title or claim to the aforesaid service or labor of said
                        <persName>Frank Ingersoll</persName> in manner following, viz:            
            <pb xml:id="leaf001v" facs="cww.00254.002.jpg"/>
                            by his intermarriage with <persName>Lucy Parkman</persName> of the State of
                        <placeName>Georgia</placeName> in the year <date when="1857">1857</date> ,
                    and the title or claim of your petitioner's wife was acquired by inheritance,
                    the family of said <persName>Frank Ingersoll</persName>, including his mother
                    and your petitioner thinks his grandmother and grandfather having belonged to
                    the family of his said wife in <placeName>Georgia</placeName> and were so held
                    to service or labor from the time of their birth: said
                        <persName>Frank</persName> was brought by me to
                        <placeName>Washington</placeName> in <date when="1858">1858</date> where he
                    has remained as my property ever since.</p>

                <p>That your petitioner's claim to the service or labor of said <persName>Frank
                        Ingersoll</persName> was at the time of said discharge therefrom, of the
                    value of nine hundred dollars ($900) in money. He is in perfect health and I
                    have always paid great attention to his moral and physical training and wants.
                    He is remarkably bright active and efficient,and while I was keeping house in
                    <placeName>Washington</placeName> and until I came to <placeName>New York</placeName> on public duty connected with the
                    Engineer's department, he had exclusive charge of my dining room and is an
                    excellent dining room servant and waiter. Your petitioner knows of no mental,
                    moral or physical 
            
            <pb xml:id="leaf002r" facs="cww.00254.003.jpg"/>
            
                infirmity or defect to impair the value of said <persName>Frank
                        Ingersoll</persName>'s service or labor.</p>

                <p>Your petitioner hereby declares that he bears true and faithful allegiance to the
                    Government of the <placeName>United States</placeName>, and that he has not borne arms against the
                    <placeName>United States</placeName> in the present rebellion nor in any way given aid or comfort
                    thereto.</p>

                <p>And your petitioner further states and alleges that he has not brought said
                        <persName>Frank Ingersoll</persName> into the <placeName>District of
                        Columbia</placeName> since the passage of said act of Congress; and that at
                    the time of the passage thereof said <persName>Frank Ingersoll</persName> was
                    held to service or labor therein under and by virtue of your petitioner's claim
                    to such service or labor.</p>
                <p>Your petitioner further states and alleges that his said claim to the service or
                    labor of said <persName>Frank Ingersoll</persName> does not originate in or by
                    virtue of any transfer heretofore made by any person who has in any manner aided
                    or sustained the present rebellion against the Government of the <placeName>United
                        States</placeName>.</p>
                <p>And your petitioner prays the said Commissioners to investigate and determine the
                    validity of his said claim to the service or labor of said <persName>Frank
                        Ingersoll</persName> herein above set forth: and if the same be found to be
                    valid, that they appraise

                    apportion the value of said claim in money, and report the same to the Secretary
                    of the Treasury of the <placeName>United States</placeName>, in conformity to the provisions of said
                    act of Congress.</p>
