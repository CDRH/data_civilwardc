Chronic diarrhœa and insanity.  [This man appears on the register of <name type="hospital" key="176">Lincoln hospital</name>, Washington, D. C., admitted <date type="admit" when="1864-03-25">March 25, 1864</date>—insanity—deserted <date type="deserted" when="1864-04-01">April 1st</date>.]  The patient was exceedingly emaciated, passed his stools and urine involuntarily, and was much deranged in mind. It was found necessary to watch him constantly to prevent him from swallowing the medicine prescribed for others, which he would do regardless of taste or consequences. Alteratives, astringents and stimulants were tried without beneficial effect.  Died, <date type="death" when="1864-08-27">August 27th</date>.  <hi rend="italic">Autopsy:</hi> Brain not examined. The lungs were healthy. No inflammation of the mucous membrane of the small or large intestine was detected. The liver and spleen were soft and dark colored, breaking down readily under pressure.</p>
   <p>⃰ It is to be regretted that, in most instances, the records of this hospital do not show by whom the autopsies were made. It is known that many of them were made by <name type="person" key="134">Surgeon Bentley</name> himself, or under his immediate supervision, but it is only possible to distinguish these from the others in a few cases.</p>
