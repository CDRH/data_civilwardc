                    penetrated the cranium just above the right frontal eminence, causing a stellate
                    fracture with cleanly cut edges.  On <date type="admit" when="1862-09-01">September 1st</date> he was admitted to the <name type="hospital" key="428">Judiciary Square Hospital</name>, being perfectly conscious. All his

                    of the hemisphere.  At the point of entrance there was an abscess the size of a

                    found in the left ventricle.   The case is reported by <name type="person"
