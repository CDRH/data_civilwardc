                                        moist, tongue pale and coated and colon tender on pressure.
                                        Quinine was given. He had a chill at 2 P. M., and in the
                                        evening the skin was hot and dry and the tongue very red,
                                        flabby and coated. On the 6th, 7th and 8th he had no fever
                                        at the morning visit; but in the evening the skin was hot
                                        and dry and the bowels somewhat relaxed and tender; his
                                        complexion was sallow and his mind rather dull. He was
                                        treated with Dover's powder and small doses of blue-pill.
                                        After the 9th there was slight fever at the morning visit,
                                        but the patient was able to be up and walk around a little
                                        until the 12th; the tongue was dry, brown, yellow and white
                                        by turns, but usually red at the tip; the pulse was weak, 80
                                        when lying, 100 when standing; the bowels were moved from
                                        one to three times daily, and there was always some
                                        tenderness along the track of the colon. On the 15th two
                                        bloody stools were passed and the patient was much
                                        depressed, the colon tender, the tongue thickly coated
                                        yellow, the skin hot and sweating, pulse 86. A blister was
                                        applied over the colon and opium and tannin prescribed. The
                                        bowels remained quiet until the 17th, when an enema of soap
                                        was administered. At this time there was some tenderness in
                                        the right iliac region. On th 18th the stomach was irritable
                                        and the pulse ran up to 120. Vomiting continued next day and
                                        was accompanied with acute tenderness in the epigastrium;
                                        the patient lay on his back with his legs drawn up. On 
                                        <date type="death" when="1861-09-21">the 21st</date> the
                                        pulse was 140, tongue nearly clean but very dry, skin hot,
                                        abdomen tender. In the evening the body became covered with
                                        a profuse sweat, the extremities cold, the features pinched,
                                        the pulse imperceptible, the heart's action irregular,
                                        speedily ending in stupor and death. No rose-colored spots
                                        were discovered in this case although specially looked for.
