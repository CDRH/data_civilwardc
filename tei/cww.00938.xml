                    life of the said <persName>George Quander</persName> and <persName>Ned
                        Quander</persName>; and that by the said Act of Congress the said
                        <persName>George Quander</persName> &#38; <persName>Ned Quander</persName>
                    are discharged &#38; freed of and from all claim of your petitioner to such
                    service &#38; labor; that at the time of the said discharge said <persName>George

                        Quander</persName>, by the decease of <persName>Francis Johnston
                        Senr</persName> who owned them for more than thirty years; that your
                    petitioner's claim to the service or labor of said <persName>George
                        Quander</persName> &#38; <persName>Ned Quander</persName>, was, at the time

                        facs="cww.00938.002.jpg"/>value of Fourteen hundred dollars each in
                    money.</p>

                <p>Your petitioner hereby declares that he bears true &#38; faithful allegiance to the
                    government of the <placeName>United States</placeName>, &#38; that he has not
                    borne arms against the <placeName>United States</placeName> in the present
                    rebellion, nor in any way given aid or comfort thereto.</p>

                <p>And your petitioner further states and alleges that he has not brought said
                        <persName>George Quander</persName> &#38; <persName>Ned Quander</persName>
                    into the <placeName>District of Columbia</placeName> since the passage of the said
                    Act of Congress; and that, at the time of the passage thereof, said
                        <persName>George Quander</persName> &#38; <persName>Ned Quander</persName>
                    were held to service or labor therein under &#38; by virtue of your petitioners
                    claim for himself &#38; his coheirs to such service or labor.</p>

                <p>Your petitioner further states and alleges, that his said claim to the service or
                    labor of the said <persName>George Quander</persName> <persName>Ned
                        Quander</persName> does not originate in or by virtue of any transfer
                    heretofore made by any person who has in any manner aided or sustained the
                    present rebellion against the government of the <placeName>United
                        States</placeName>.</p>

                <p>And your petitioner, for himself and his coheirs, prays the said Commissioners to
                    investigate and determine the validity of their said claim to the service &#38;
                    labor of the said <persName>George Quander</persName> &#38; <persName>Ned
                        Quander</persName> herein above set forth; &#38; if the same be found to be
