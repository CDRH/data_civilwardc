     which he contributed a photograph (<hi rend="italic">Contr. Photo's</hi>, S. G. O., Vol. I, No. 41), with the following history: "The patient was admitted <date type="admit" when="1865-04-05">April 5th</date>. He had been wounded by a ball entering just above the patella, through which it passed and which it fractured into six fragments. Ranging downward and outward the
     missile fractured the external condyles of the femur and escaped. On <date type="operation" when="1865-04-08">April 8th</date>, the patient was
     etherized, when the fractured patella and a fragment of the external condyle of the femur were
     removed. The constitutional state of the patient at the time of the operation was very good.
     After the operation the limb was placed in a box containing bran and the patient was put on low
     diet. Subsequently the limb was placed upon a light open splint, extending from the tuberosity
     of the ischium to a point near the heel, and suspended by a cord. The patient was put on
     nutritious diet, with wine and porter. On April 13th, he was transferred to a tent ward. Up to
     this time he had suffered considerable pain in the joint and was very restless and irritable.
     His appetite now became poor, and hiccough and vomiting set in. Suppuration was profuse. The
     patient died <date type="death" when="1865-04-22">April 22, 1865</date>, from exhaustion."</p>
