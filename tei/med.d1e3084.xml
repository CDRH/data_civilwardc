                                        recurring chill and fever, and a diarrh&#339;a causing
                                        about six stools daily. He was admitted <date type="admit"

                                        remittent fever. The tongue was pale, flabby and coated, the
                                        face flushed, the skin warm and moist, the pulse 86, the
                                        bowels loose. A small dose of tincture of opium was given.
                                        Next day quinine was ordered, with Dover's powder at night.
                                        He had no chill after admission, but there was an evening
                                        exacerbation of fever, which on the 9th and 10th was
                                        accompanied by drowsiness and stupidity. On the morning of
                                        the 11th the remission was very marked, and in the evening
                                        the appetite became improved. On the evening of the 12th the
                                        tongue, which had been flabby and coated hitherto, became
                                        clean. The bowels were relaxed throughout the attack, but
                                        there was no tenderness except on the 9th, in the umbilical
                                        region. On this day also there was a slight cough with a
                                        stitch in the right side. The diarrh&#339;a abated with
                                        the decline of the fever and the cleaning of the tongue. The
                                        patient was transferred to hospital at <name type="place">Baltimore, Md.</name>, on
