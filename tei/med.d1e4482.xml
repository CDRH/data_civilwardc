                                        admitted as a case of typhoid fever. In the evening the
                                        patient's face was flushed and he had nausea and loss of
                                        appetite, pulse 92, skin warm and moist, tongue moist,
                                        yellowish and heavily coated, bowels quiet. Ten grains each
                                        of calomel and jalap were given; two dejections followed,
                                        and next morning the tongue was cleaner at the tip and
                                        edges. Quinine was ordered. In the evening there was no
                                        fever, the skin was cool, moist and perspiring; one stool
                                        was passed during the day, and there was tenderness in the
                                        right iliac region. On the morning of the 18th there was no
                                        fever, the skin being cool and moist, and the abdominal
                                        tenderness relieved; but in the evening the patient had one
                                        thin, large stool, and the right iliac region became acutely
                                        tender. Dover's powder was prescribed. On the 19th there was
                                        tympanites and the iliac region continued tender, but the
                                        skin remained cool and moist and the bowels quiet. The
                                        condition of the patient was changed on the 20th only by the
                                        diminution of the tympanites; one stool was passed during
                                        the day. On the 21st there was deafness with anxiety of
                                        expression; there was also some thirst, but the appetite was
                                        good and skin natural. The tongue was clean on the 22d, the
                                        pulse 68, small and soft, the skin natural, the bowels quiet
                                        and neither tender nor tympanitic, but the face was somewhat
                                        flushed. In the evening rose-spots made their appearance,
                                        and a second crop on the 24th. Wine and bark were ordered.
                                        He was reported as walking about on the 30th, and was
                                        transferred to <name type="place">Annapolis, Md.</name>, <date type="transfer" when="1861-10-01">October 1</date>. </p>
