     through the skin on the inner side of the thigh, about two inches below the perinæum,
     through which the ball was removed by the forceps. The limb was bandaged in its whole length
     and laid upon a mattress, being supported by sand bags and extended by weight and pulley. On
     July 5th the patient was able to ride about the ward in an invalid chair, and a few days later
     he walked on crutches. By July 16th the bone had firmly united, with only one inch shortening,
     though there was still a slight discharge from the wound. The patient's general health was
     remarkably good." He was subsequently transferred to Harvey Hospital, <name type="place">Madison</name>, and ultimately discharged from Camp Randall <date type="servicedischarge" when="1865-11-15">November 15, 1865</date>, <name type="person" key="xx">Acting Assistant
