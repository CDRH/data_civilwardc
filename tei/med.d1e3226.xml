                                        Diagnosis&#8212;debility. He had been sick about a week,
                                        first with chills, afterwards with fever. On admission he
                                        was wakeful and had headache, dizziness, buzzing in the
                                        ears, anorexia, thirst, vomiting, diarrh&#339;a and
                                        cough. Next day the wakefulness continued; pulse 100, quick,
                                        full and firm; skin hot and presenting a few rose-colored
                                        spots on the chest; there was slight headache with tinnitus
                                        aurium; the tongue was slightly moist and furred white, but
                                        red on the tip, edges and central line; the appetite was
                                        good, but there was considerable thirst; the bowels were
                                        slightly relaxed, tympanitic and tender on pressure in the
                                        umbilical and left iliac regions; there was also some cough
                                        with frothy sputa. He slept well during the following night,
                                        and on the morning of the 3d the pulse was reduced to 80,
                                        but otherwise the symptoms continued as already stated.
                                        Treatment was by sulphate of quinine and astringents. On the
                                        6th the diarrh&#339;a became suddenly aggravated, five
                                        stools having been passed in the twenty-four hours,
                                        accompanied with abdominal tenderness and gurgling. Next day
                                        three stools were passed and on the 8th one stool.
                                        Improvement was progressive after this, but on the <date
