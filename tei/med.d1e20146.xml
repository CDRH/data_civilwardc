                                                                years, was wounded at <name type="BATTLE" key="xxx">Petersburg</name>, <date type="injury" when="1865-03-25">March 25th, 1865</date>, by a conoidal ball, which entered beneath
                                                  the inferior angle of the left scapula, passed
                                                  through the pleura, and emerged at the anterior
                                                  superior border of the left axillary space. He was
                                                  treated in the field hospital of the Ninth Corps, until <date type="transfer" when="1865-04-24">April 24th</date>, when he was transferred to

                                                  there was considerable dyspn&#339;a, with excessive
                                                  pain, which was increased by coughing. At each
                                                  forcible expiration the air was expelled from the
                                                  wound of the back. Stimulants and anodynes were
                                                  given. Whenever the patient moved he complained of
                                                  a gurgling sensation. On percussion in the
                                                  recumbent and upright position, it was decided

                                                  thoracic cavity. The cavity was opened by

                                                  twelve ounces of pure pus withdrawn, by means of a
                                                  Flint's evacuator. Air was forced from the
                                                  thoracic cavity through the wound in the arm.
                                                  Morphine given to allay pain. On June 2d,
                                                  h&#230;morrhage occurred from the cavity near the
                                                  axillary space, and the patient died on <date type="death" when="1865-06-02">the same
