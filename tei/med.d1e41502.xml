[This man appears on the register of the hospital, of the 2d Division, 11th Corps, <name type="place">Fairfax Court-House, Virginia</name>, admitted <date type="admit" when="1862-11-03">November 3, 1862</date>—phthisis; no disposition recorded.]  Died, <date type="death" when="1863-02-02">February 2d</date>, eleven days after admission.  <hi rend="italic">Autopsy</hi> <date type="autopsy" when="1863-02-03">eighteen hours after death</date>: Body much emaciated. The heart was very small; the coronary vessels tortuous, like varicose veins. There were firm pleuritic adhesions on the left side; in other respects the thoracic viscera were healthy. The abdominal viscera also appeared to be healthy, except that there was some ulceration of the mucous membrane of the small intestine.</p> 
   <p>⃰ It is to be regretted that, in most instances, the records of this hospital do not show by whom the autopsies were made. It is known that many of them were made by <name type="person" key="134">Surgeon Bentley</name> himself, or under his immediate supervision, but it is only possible to distinguish these from the others in a few cases.</p>
