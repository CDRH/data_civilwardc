                                        a case of gastritis. His eyes were suffused; pulse 95, full
                                        and strong; skin moist but somewhat hot; tongue dry, red and
                                        glossy; constipation, anorexia and great irritability of the
                                        stomach were present. Sulphate of magnesia and antimony were
                                        given, and ten grains of calomel in the evening. The Epsom
                                        salt was repeated on the 5th. Next day two grains of quinine
                                        were given every two hours, and tincture of iron on the 7th.
                                        One stool was obtained on this day; the gastric irritation
                                        had somewhat lessened; pulse 70. On the 9th the pulse fell
                                        to 45, the skin was of natural temperature, the tongue red,
                                        clean and moist but rather flabby, the appetite moderate and
                                        the bowels unmoved. Rose-colored spots appeared on the 10th;
                                        the appetite was poor; the bowels unmoved and tender. Two
                                        compound cathartic pills were given, with turpentine
                                        emulsion, every three hours, and two grains of quinine every
                                        hour. Next day one stool was obtained, and there was marked
                                        tenderness with gurgling in the right iliac and umbilical
                                        regions. Some irritability of stomach, cough, pain in chest,
                                        suffusion of eyes and congestion of face were noted on this
                                        day; pulse 50; skin natural; tongue moist, red and clean. On
                                        the 13th, the bowels having continued unmoved and tender in
                                        the interval, a cathartic enema was given; this was followed
                                        on the 16th by an ounce and a half of castor oil. Three
                                        stools were passed on the 17th, three on the 18th, and
                                        seven, twelve and fifteen on the following days, after which
                                        two stools were recorded daily for several days, with some
                                        abdominal tenderness. Rose-spots were noted on the 14th. The
