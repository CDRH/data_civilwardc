                <head type="main">PETITION.</head>
                <p rend="bold">To the Commissioners under the act of Congress approved the <date when="1862-04-16">16th of
                    April, 1862</date>, entitled "An act for the release of certain persons held to service or
                    labor in the <placeName>District of Columbia</placeName>."</p>
                
                <p>Your Petitioner, <seg type="handwritten"><persName>Mary A. Perry</persName>, wife of <persName>Thomas J. Perry</persName></seg> of <seg type="handwritten"><placeName>Washington City</placeName></seg> by this <seg type="handwritten">her</seg> petition in writing, represents and states, that <seg type="handwritten">she</seg> is a person loyal to the <placeName>United States</placeName>, who, at the time of the passage of the said act of Congress, held a claim to service or labor against <seg type="handwritten">one male</seg> person of African descent of the name of <seg type="handwritten"><persName>Adam Johnson</persName>,</seg> for and during the life of said <seg type="handwritten"><persName>Adam Johnson</persName>,</seg> and that by said act of Congress said <seg type="handwritten"><persName>Adam Johnson</persName>, was</seg> discharged and freed of and from all claim of your petitioner to such service or labor; that at the time of said discharge said <seg type="handwritten"><persName>Adam Johnson</persName> was</seg> of the age of <seg type="handwritten">twenty three years,</seg> and of the personal description following:<note type="government" place="foot" xml:id="n1">Here describe the person, so as to identify him or her; and if there be more than one slave, describe each one separately.</note> <seg type="handwritten">About five feet six inches high, very black; nappy head; flat nose and broad teeth, a gap in his two upper teeth; low forehead; and is strong and healthy. She knows not where he is, but has heard that he was employed as a laborer in the Navy Yard during a part of last Spring. She could not file her Petition during the time fixed by law, because she was in prison in the Jail of <placeName>Westmoreland County, Virginia</placeName>, on account of her strong Union sentiments, until <date when="1862-07">July last</date>; and her husband was engaged in Fishing down the <placeName>Potomac River</placeName> and did not know of the Act above referred to until it was too late. She knows that her Husband is loyal to the <placeName>United States</placeName>, and would have filed a Petition if he had known of the law in time. He is now absent down the River in the Oyster Trade.</seg></p>

                <p>That your petitioner acquired <seg type="handwritten">her</seg> claim to the aforesaid service or labor of said <seg type="handwritten"><persName>Adam Johnson</persName>,</seg> in manner following:<note type="government" place="foot" xml:id="n2">Here state how the claim was acquired, when, from whom, and for what price or consideration; and, if held under any written evidence of title, make exhibit thereof, or refer to the public record where the same may be found.</note> <seg type="handwritten">He was left to her by her first Husband, <persName>William H. Crask</persName>, who died in this City about seven years ago; and she believes about that time there was a record of him entered in one of the Courts or one of the Corporation Offices in this City.</seg></p>
                
                <p>That your petitioner's claim to the service or labor of said <seg type="handwritten"><persName>Adam Johnson</persName></seg> was, at the time of said discharge therefrom, of the value of <seg type="handwritten">one thousand</seg> dollars in money.<note type="government" place="foot" xml:id="n3">Here state such facts, if any there be, touching the value of the petitioner's claim to the service or labor of the person, as may enhance the same, and also such facts, if any, touching the moral, mental, and bodily infirmities or defects of said person, as impair the value of the petitioner's claim to such service or labor, and conclude such statement with an averment that the petitioner knows of no other infirmities or defects of said person which impair the value of petitioner's claim to such service or labor, and that he believes none other to exist. If the petitioner specify no such infirmity or defect, then his statement touching the value of his claim should conclude with an averment that he has no knowledge of any such infirmity or defect.</note> <seg type="handwritten">She believes he was assessed at one thousand dollars sometime since; he is strong and healthy, and she knows of no moral, mental, or bodily infirmities or defects to impair his value, and does not believe that any such exist.</seg></p>
                
                <p>Your petitioner hereby declares that <seg type="handwritten">she</seg> bears true and faithful allegiance to the Government of the <placeName>United States</placeName>, and that <seg type="handwritten">she</seg> has not borne arms against the <placeName>United States</placeName> in the present rebellion, nor in any way given aid or comfort thereto.</p>
                
                <p>And your petitioner further states and alleges, that <seg type="handwritten">she</seg> has not brought said <seg type="handwritten"><persName>Adam Johnson</persName></seg> into the <placeName>District of Columbia</placeName> since the passage of said act of Congress; and that, at the time of the passage thereof, said <seg type="handwritten"><persName>Adam Johnson</persName></seg> was held to service or labor therein under and by virtue of your petitioner's claim to such service or labor.</p>
                
                <p>Your petitioner further states and alleges, that <seg type="handwritten">her</seg> said claim to the service or labor of said <seg type="handwritten"><persName>Adam Johnson</persName></seg> does not originate in or by virtue of any transfer heretofore made by any person who has in any manner aided or sustained the present rebellion against the Government of the <placeName>United States</placeName>.</p>
                
                <p>And your petitioner prays the said Commissioners to investigate and determine the validity of <seg type="handwritten">her</seg> said claim to the service or labor of said <seg type="handwritten"><persName>Adam Johnson</persName></seg> herein above set forth; and if the same be found to be valid, that they appraise and apportion the value of said claim in money, and report the same to the Secretary of the Treasury of the <placeName>United States</placeName>, in conformity to the provisions of said act of Congress.</p>
