                                                  severe pain. Simple dressings were applied to the
                                                  wounds, and as he could not use any solid food,
                                                  beef-tea and chicken-broth, combined with a milk
                                                  diet, was ordered. He stated that several pieces
                                                  of bone had been removed in the field hospital. On

                                                  discharges ichorous. The swelling of the face was
                                                  disappearing. He lost the sight of the right eye
                                                  by retinitis. On <date type="injury" when="1862-09-13">the 13th</date>, hæmorrhage, which
                                                  recurred several times, took place from the wound
                                                  of exit. The amount of blood lost at each time
                                                  was small, owing to the immediate application of

                                                  artery could be discovered upon examination. He
                                                  was very weak and reduced when the hæmorrhage
                                                  occurred. He died on <date type="death" when="1862-09-22">September 22d, 1862</date>. There
