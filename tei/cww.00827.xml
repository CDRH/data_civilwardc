            <div1 type="petition" subtype="handwritten">
                <p>To the Commissioners under the Act of Congress approved the <date when="1862-04-16">16th of April 1862</date>
                    entitled "An act for the release of certain persons held to service or labor in
                    the <placeName>District of Columbia</placeName>."</p>

                <p>Your Petitioner, <persName>Mary Johnston</persName>, of <placeName>Fairfax County,
                        Virginia</placeName>, by this her petition in writing, represents and
                    states that she is a person loyal to the <placeName>United States</placeName>,
                    who, at the time of the passage of the said act of Congress, held a claim to
                    service or labor against a person of African descent of the name of
                        <persName>Addison Jones</persName> for and during the life of the said
                        <persName>Addison Jones</persName>, and that by said Act of Congress said
                        <persName>Addison Jones</persName> is discharged and freed of and from all
                    claim of your petitioner to such service or labor; that at the time of said
                    discharge said <persName>Addison Jones</persName> was of the age of thirty two
                    years, about five feet seven inches in height, dark mulatto and stout built:</p>

                <p>That your petitioner acquired her claim to the aforesaid service or <choice><orig>labour</orig><reg>labor</reg></choice> of said <persName>Addison Jones</persName> by the death of her father
                        <persName>Dennis Johnston</persName>:</p>

                <p>That your petitioner's claim to the service or labor of said <persName>Addison
                        Jones</persName>, was, at the time of said discharge therefrom, of the value
                    of Fourteen hundred dollars in money:</p>

                <p>Your petitioner hereby declares that she bears true and faithful allegiance to
                    the government of the <placeName>United States</placeName>, and that she has not
                    borne arms against the <placeName>United States</placeName> in the present
                    rebellion, nor in any way given aid or comfort thereto:</p>
                
                <pb xml:id="leaf001v" facs="cww.00827.002.jpg"/>
                <p>And your petitioner further states &amp; alleges that she has not brought the
                    said <persName>Addison Jones</persName> into the <placeName>District of
                        Columbia</placeName> since the passage of said act of Congress; and that, at
                    the time of the passage thereof, said <persName>Addison Jones</persName> was
                    held to service or labor therein under and by virtue of your petitioner's claim
                    to such service or labor.</p>

                <p>Your petitioner further alleges and states that her said claim to the service or
                    labor of the said <persName>Addison Jones</persName>, does not originate in or
                    by virtue of any transfer heretofore made by any person who has in any manner
                    aided or sustained the present rebellion against the government of the
                        <placeName>United States</placeName>.</p>

                <p>And your petitioner prays the said Commissioners to investigate and determine the
                    validity of her said claim to the service or labor of said <persName>Addison
                        Jones</persName>, herein above set forth; and if the same be found to be
                    valid, that they appraise and apportion the value of said claim in money, and
                    report the same to the Secretary of the Treasury of the <placeName>United
                        States</placeName>, in conformity to the provisions of the said act of
                    Congress.</p>
