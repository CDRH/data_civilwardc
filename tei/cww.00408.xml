                            color, 5 feet 1/4 inch high. This girl is an excellent seamstress,
                            chambermaid, parlor and dining room servant and house maid generally.
                            She is healthy, active and intelligent&#8212;her just value claimed
                            is $800.</item>
                    </list>
                </p>

                <p>This statement and schedule embracing the names, sexes, ages and personal
                    description of the said colored persons, will be found also to embrace the
                    personal condition and qualifications of each of those persons, these items
                    being necessary to complete their personal description, and having a direct
                    relation to their value, or that of their service and labor, as required to be
                    stated by the second section of the aforementioned act.</p>

                <p>It is also but just, in this connection, to state the fact, that much time and
                    trouble have been taken in instructing these servants, from their infancy, in
                    their respective duties as stated, which has rendered them very valuable in the
                    several avocations above mentioned; and that, the sudden operation of this law,
                    depriving the claimant of the services of the servants, has made a radical
                    change in the mode of working and managing his farm and in the domestic
                    arrangements
                    
                    <pb xml:id="leaf004r" facs="cww.00408.007.jpg"/>
                    
                    and has subjected
                    your petitioner to new and expensive modes of having the work done, that has
                    heretofore been performed by these servants; and their value to the petitioner
                    can be best appreciated and calculated, when there is taken into view, the amount
                    of wages and other expenses that he will have to pay, to replace all the labor,
                    service and advantages derived from these servants, of which he has been so
                    suddenly deprived by the instantaneous operation of the aforesaid act.</p>

                <p>It may also be proper for the claimant to state, that the aggregate of the whole
                    of the foregoing valuation, is less by five thousand dollars, than was offered
                    by a gentleman from <placeName>Texas</placeName> for those servants, on account
                    of their character, condition, and qualifications, a short time before the
                    breaking out of the present rebellion, which was declined because it would
                    separate married people, and remove the others forever from their relations and
                    friends, and also, because they supplied and subserved all the requirements, and
                    could not be replaced in the homestead, on the farm and in the garden so
                    satisfactorily by other persons.</p>

                <p>Your petitioner therefore respectfully prays the allowance of the valuation
                    placed by him on those colored persons, respectively, in the foregoing schedule,
                    knowing the same to be less than he could have obtained for them, before the
                    rebellion broke out, and probably much less than he would have been able to
                    obtain for them, when the rebellion shall have been overcome, had not this act
                    been passed by Congress, and he therefore
                    
                    <pb xml:id="leaf004v" facs="cww.00408.008.jpg"/>
                    
                    believes that the adoption of this valuation
                    would be within the term "just compensation" which the constitution provides for
                    the private citizen, in such cases, and which he is happy to believe may be
                    accorded to him, under the liberal appropriation by Congress, on the basis of a
                    slave population in this <placeName>District</placeName>, of upwards of three
                    thousand persons, the average being evidently extended to that number, which
                    would appear to fully authorize the allowance of a "just compensation" according
                    to the Constitution, for a much less number of colored persons, provided the
                    whole sum allowed for all slaves in the <placeName>District of
                        Columbia</placeName> shall not exceed the sum of money appropriated.</p>

                <p>As regards the loyalty of your petitioner, he has the honor to state, that when
                    invested with the command of a Brigade of the Militia of the <placeName>District
                        of Columbia</placeName>, he took the oath to support the Constitution, and
                    to perform the duties of a Brigadier General; that on the <date when="1861-08-26">26th day of August, 1861</date>, he took the oath of
                    allegiances as chief clerk in the Senate of the United States, as required by
                    the act of the <date when="1861-08-06">6th day of August, 1861</date>, a copy of
                    which oath is hereto annexed, and which he now reiterates, and that he not only "has not borne arms against the United States
                    during the present rebellion, nor in any way given aid and comfort thereto," but
                    that he assisted in raising volunteers to defend the government in
                        <placeName>Washington</placeName>, when it was daily threatened by attack,
                    and, being the Senior Brigadier, he verbally and in writing, offered his
                    services to the Commanding General, and through him to the War Department, as
                    being willing and ready to perform his duty
                    
                    <pb xml:id="leaf005r" facs="cww.00408.009.jpg"/>
                    
                    to his country in defence of its government and
                    national authorities.</p>

                <p>All of which is now verified by the oath of your petitioner and is most
                    respectfully submitted</p>
