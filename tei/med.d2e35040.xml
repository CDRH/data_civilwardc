A catheter was introduced into the bladder and maintained in position till death. There was a scanty flow of urine through the catheter, and during the last few days it was intimately mixed with pus. The surrounding tissues were much discolored, and would have sloughed extensively had the patient survived a violent irritative fever, of which he died <date type="death" when="1862-09-14">September 14, 1862</date>."</p>
