                                        seized with pain in the head and bones, fever and chills; he
                                        had some nausea and vomiting at first, and a
                                        diarrh&#339;a which continued for two days; the headache
                                        lasted four days; during the second week his urine had to be
                                        removed by catheter. On admission his pulse was 62 and of
                                        fair strength, skin soft and warm, tongue pale, moist and
                                        slightly coated brownish in the centre, appetite good; he
                                        had tinnitus aurium and giddiness, but no pain, eruption nor sudamina; one
                                        thin watery stool was passed, but there was no tenderness,
                                        borborygmus nor tympanites, and the abdomen was soft; there
                                        was no cough and the urine was normal. Quinine was
                                        prescribed in full doses three times daily. Next day the
                                        face was calm and natural, the pulse 64, steady and of fair
                                        strength, the skin soft and warm, the tongue slightly pale
                                        and flabby but moist and clean, the appetite good; one thin
                                        fetid stool was passed. On the 22d the quinine was reduced
                                        to two grains three times daily, and during the night the
                                        patient had a chill, but next day its effects disappeared.
                                        On the 28th he rested badly and had some diarrh&#339;a,
                                        but there was no tenderness nor tympanites; the tongue was
                                        pale and moist and the appetite fair. The skin and
                                        conjunctiv&#230; became jaundiced on the 31st. Small
                                        doses of calomel and opium were given. November 1 he slept
                                        well; his mind was clear, countenance calm, bowels regular
                                        and appetite good. He was transferred to <name type="place">Annapolis, Md.</name>, on
