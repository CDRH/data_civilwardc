                <p>To the Commissioners under the act of Congress approved the <date
                        when="1862-04-16">16th of April 1862</date>, entitled "An act for the

                <p>Your Petitioner <persName>William S Johnston</persName> of <placeName>Fairfax

                    Congress, held a claim to service or <choice><orig>labour</orig><reg>labor</reg></choice> against <persName>Henson
                        Nokes</persName> and <persName>Frederick Smith</persName>, persons of African
                    descent, for and during the life of the said <persName>Henson Nokes</persName>
                    and <persName>Frederick Smith</persName>; and that by said Act of Congress they
                    are discharged and freed of and from all claim of your petitioner to such
                    service or <choice><orig>labour</orig><reg>labor</reg></choice>; that at the time of said discharge the said <persName>Henson
                        Nokes</persName> was of the age of forty years, bright, five feet eight
                    inches in height, and slender made, and is supposed to be now living with his

                <p>That your petitioner acquired his claim to the aforesaid service or <choice><orig>labour</orig><reg>labor</reg></choice> of said <persName>Henson Nokes</persName> and <persName>Frederick
                        Smith</persName> By purchase about 7 years ago by the death of his father
                        <persName>Dennis Johnston</persName>. That your petitioners claim to the
                    service or <choice><sic>labour</sic><corr>labor</corr></choice> of the said <persName>Henson Nokes</persName>, was, at the time of
                    said discharge therefrom, of the value of $800 dollars in money, and of the said
                        <persName>Frederick Smith</persName> of the value of $1400 dollars in
                        money.</p>

                <p>Your petitioner hereby declares that he bears true and faithful allegiance to the
                    government of the <placeName>United States</placeName>, and that he has not
                    borne arms against the <placeName>United States</placeName> in the present
                    rebellion, nor in any way given aid or comfort thereto.</p>

                <p>And your petitioner further states &#38; alleges that he has not brought said
                        <persName>Henson Nokes</persName> and <persName>Frederick Smith</persName>
                    into the <placeName>District of Columbia</placeName>, since the passage of the said
                    Act of Congress; and that at the time of the passage thereof said
                        <persName>Nokes</persName> &#38; <persName>Smith</persName> were held to
                    service or <choice><sic>labour</sic><corr>labor</corr></choice> therein, under and by virtue of your petitioner's claim to such
                    service or <choice><sic>labour</sic><corr>labor</corr></choice>.</p>

                <p>Your petitioner further states and alleges that his said claim to the service or
                    <choice><sic>labour</sic><corr>labor</corr></choice> of the said <persName>Nokes</persName> and <persName>Smith</persName> does
                    not originate in or by virtue of any transfer heretofore made by any person who
                    has in any manner aided or sustained the present rebellion against the
                    Government of the <placeName>United States</placeName>.</p>

                <p>And your petitioner prays the said Commissioners to investigate and determine the
                    validity of his said claim to the service or <choice><sic>labour</sic><corr>labor</corr></choice> of said <persName>Henson
                        Nokes</persName> and <persName>Frederick Smith</persName> herein above set
                    forth; &#38; if the same be found to be valid, that they appraise &#38; apportion
                    the value of said claim in money &#38; report the same to the Secretary of the
                    Treasury of the <placeName>United States</placeName>, in conformity to the
                    provisions of said act of Congress.</p>
