                                                  conoidal ball, which entered three-fourths of an
                                                  inch outside of the outer canthus of the left
                                                  eye, passed through the zygomatic arch, grooved
                                                  the squamous portion of the temporal bone for a
                                                  distance of two inches, involving both tables, and
                                                  partly imbedded itself in the brain.  He remained
                                                  in a field hospital until <date type="transfer" when="1864-06-08">June 8th</date>, when he was

                                                  but not understandingly. The pupils were
                                                  moderately dilated; the pulse 78 and weak.  On <date type="operation" when="1864-06-09">the following day</date> he was etherized, and the ball and
                                                  some fragments of the bone were removed through an
                                                  incision in the scalp. The wound was full of
                                                  pieces of fractured bone, and exhibited a
                                                  disposition to slough. The incision was united by
                                                  two stitches, and cold water dressings and a
                                                  bandage were applied. For an hour subsequent to
                                                  the operation the patient was very wild, requiring
                                                  to be held in bed. He gradually became quiet, and
                                                  slept during the night.  On the 12th, he answered
                                                  some interrogatories correctly; his appetite was
                                                  good, and his bowels open.  He continued in this condition,
                                                  eating and sleeping well and answering questions,
