                                        having been sick for a week before admission with headache,
                                        epistaxis, anorexia, thirst and cough. On the 2d the
                                        patient's eyes were suffused, face congested, pulse 100,
                                        full and strong, skin hot, tongue red at the tip and edges
                                        and coated yellowish in the centre; appetite poor; he had
                                        epistaxis during the day and one passage from the bowels,
                                        which gurgled and were tender on pressure, particularly on
                                        the right side; he had also some cough with yellowish
                                        blood-streaked sputa. The epistaxis did not recur, and next
                                        day he had headache, which was accompanied by mental
                                        hebetude on the 4th and by delirium on the 5th. An
                                        eight-grain dose of quinine, turpentine emulsion three times
                                        a day, and six grains of calomel with one of opium at night,
                                        were prescribed on the 4th. Rose-colored spots appeared on
                                        the chest at this time, as also dryness of the tongue and
                                        blackening of the teeth and lips from sordes. The delirium
                                        lasted only one day, but the <choice><orig>dulness</orig><reg>dullness</reg></choice> of mind persisted. A
                                        diarrh&#339;a of three or four stools daily was perhaps
                                        due to the calomel, which was repeated on the 5th. Much
                                        abdominal tenderness and tympanites were also present; the
                                        appetite, however, continued good and the thirst was
                                        lessened. The tongue became moist and covered with white
                                        patches on the 6th, swollen and coated on the 7th and 8th
                                        and clean on the 10th; but the skin did not become moist
                                        until the 21st. On the 22d there was profuse perspiration.
