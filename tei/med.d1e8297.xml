                                        marked. The brain substance was healthy; the pia mater
                                        slightly congested; half a drachm of fluid was found in the
                                        ventricles. The right lung weighed twenty-four ounces, the
                                        left fifteen ounces; the lower lobes of both were much
                                        congested. The right auricle of the heart contained a venous
                                        clot which extended into the ventricle; the left auricle
                                        contained a small fibrinous clot; the pericardium was
                                        everywhere firmly attached to the heart, so that its
                                        separation was almost impossible without tearing the
                                        muscular tissue. The liver was healthy; the gall-bladder
                                        contained three ounces of a thin straw-colored liquid; the
                                        spleen was firm and dark purple on section, weight thirteen
                                        ounces and a half. The mucous membrane of the stomach was
                                        congested. The small intestine was healthy in its upper
                                        portion, but in its lower part the solitary glands were
                                        enlarged and Peyer's patches ulcerated. The large intestine
                                        was healthy. The kidneys were congested; weight of right six
                                        ounces and a half, of left seven ounces.&#8212;<hi
