     Cass</name> contributed the specimen (<hi rend="italic">Cat. Surg. Sect.</hi>, 1866, p. 234,
     <hi rend="italic">Spec</hi>. 2374) and the following report: &#34;The patient suffered
    considerable pain, had chills, was very uneasy and anxious, had no appetite, hiccough, and great
    prostration, and died <date type="death" when="1864-05-28">May 28, 1864</date>. At the <hi
     rend="italic">autopsy</hi> the left groin was found considerably discolored, and, on
    examination, it was discovered that the wound commenced just below the middle of Poupart's
    ligament, extending downward and inward, and terminating at the ischium, which was fractured.
    The ball was found near that bone, between it and the head of the femur, which was also
    fractured. The ligaments of the hip joint, the soft parts in the groin, and the upper part of
    the thigh were gangrenous.&#34; The specimen (<hi rend="initialcap">F</hi>IG. 37) consists of a
    portion of the left ischium and the upper extremity of the femur. There is a partial fracture of
    the head of the femur at its articular border and of the ischium by a battered round ball, which
    is attached. </p>
