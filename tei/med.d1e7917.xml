                        Carolina Regiment</name>, aged 18 years, was wounded, in an engagement at

                        1863</date>, by a conoidal musket ball, on the back and upper part of the
                    scalp, contusing the skull. He became unconscious, and remained so until the
                    next day.  On <date type="admit" when="1863-11-09">November 9th</date>, he was
                    admitted to the <name type="hospital" key="162">Douglas Hospital</name>,
                    Washington, D. C. He was weak and giddy, his eyes were red and injected, and
                    very sensitive to light. He had no appetite, felt stupid, and had constant
                    inclination to vomiting.  These symptoms continued for some days, but, on
                    <date type="transfer" when="1863-11-23">November 23d</date>, he was free from pain and able to walk about. His appetite had
                    improved, and the discharge from the wound looked healthy. He was transferred to
                    the <name type="hospital" key="176">Lincoln Hospital</name>, and, on <date
                        type="transfer" when="1863-12-07">December 7th, 1863,</date> sent to the
                        <name type="hospital" key="441">Old Capitol Prison</name>.   The case is
                    reported by <name type="person" key="208">Acting Assistant Surgeon Carlos Carvallo</name>. </p>
