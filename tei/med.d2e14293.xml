      Miller</name>, <name type="organization" key="459">Co. I, 72d Pennsylvania</name>, aged 21
     years, received a shot fracture of the tarsal and metatarsal bones of the left foot, at <name
      type="BATTLE" key="33">Antietam</name>, <date type="injury" when="1862-09-17">September 17,
      1862</date>. <name type="person" key="317">Assistant Surgeon J. J. Woodward</name>, <name
       type="organization" key="190">U. S. A.</name>, recorded his admission, <date type="admit" when="1862-09-23">six days after the
     injury</date>, to the <name type="hospital" key="159">Patent Office Hospital</name>, Washington, where
     the injured limb was amputated on <date type="operation" when="1862-09-28">September 28th</date>, by <name type="person" key="1108">Acting Assistant Surgeon P. Middleton</name>, the operation being performed by the circular method
     at the lower third of the leg. <date type="transfer" when="1863">Several months afterwards</date> the patient was transferred to <name
      type="hospital" key="171">Armory Square Hospital</name>, and subsequently he passed through
     several hospitals in <name type="place">Philadelphia</name>, entering Christian Street on <date type="transfer" when="1864-03-21">March 21, 1864</date>. <name
       type="person" key="xx">Acting Assistant Surgeon R. J. Levis</name>, in charge of the latter, reported
     that he found the patient's general health feeble, both bones of the stump necrosed in nearly
     their whole length, and the soft parts in a very unhealthy condition, necessitating a
     re-amputation at the lower third of the thigh, which he performed by the antero-posterior flap method on <date type="operation" when="1864-04-28">April 28, 1864</date>. He also reported that the patient reacted promptly,
     and that his general health improved greatly after the second amputation, and that the stump
     healed readily. On <date type="servicedischarge" when="1864-09-03">September 3, 1864</date>, the
     patient was discharged from service and became a pensioner. He was paid as such <date type="pension" when="1879-03-04">March 4, 1879</date>.
     The amputated bones of the foot and the soft tissues, as well as the bones removed at the
     second operation, were contributed to <name type="hospital" key="431">the Museum</name> by the
     respective operators (<hi rend="italic">Cat. Surg. Sect.</hi>, 1866, pp. 440, 503, and 402, <hi
      rend="italic">Specs</hi>. 97, 2748, and 4172). The last of these specimens is represented in
     <hi rend="initialcap">F</hi>IG. 2 of <hi rend="initialcap">P</hi>LATE <hi rend="initialcap">LXXII</hi>, opposite, showing
     the dead shafts of the tibia and fibula surrounded by a quite complete involucrum, which, in
     size, approaches hypertrophy. The extremity of the fibula is roughened, but softened as if
     carious. The tibia approaches roundness, but its extremity is incomplete, exhibiting the end of
     the sequestrum.</p>
