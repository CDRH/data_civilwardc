Chronic diarrhœa.  The patient was much emaciated, and had at the time of admission as many as twelve or fifteen passages in the twenty-four hours. The disease yielded to treatment about the latter part of September, after which, under the use of stimulants, he gained strength rapidly.  October 17th: He had a relapse which proved uncontrollable.  He died, <date type="death" when="1864-10-22">October 22d</date>, rather suddenly, having a pulse of natural frequency though feeble, and appearing tolerably strong until a few hours before death.  <hi rend="italic">Autopsy:</hi> The colon was thickened and presented numerous follicular ulcers, with some pseudomembrane adhering to the mucous membrane between them.  [The condition of the other organs is not recorded.]—<name type="person" key="229">Acting Assistant Surgeon R. B. Hitz</name>.  [No. 462, Medical Section, <name type="hospital" key="431">Army Medical Museum</name>, is from this case. The specimen is a portion of the descending colon just above the sigmoid flexure, presenting great numbers of minute follicular ulcers, between which the mucous membrane is frosted with pseudomembrane.]</p>
