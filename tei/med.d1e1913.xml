                    key="536">Co. G, 5th Connecticut Volunteers</name>, aged 48 years, was wounded
                at <name type="BATTLE" key="296">Chantilly, Virginia</name>, on <date type="injury"
                    when="1862-09-01">September 1st, 1862</date>, by several sabre blows over the
                right ear. He was taken to Washington, and admitted to <name type="hospital"
                    key="162">Douglas Hospital</name> on <date type="admit" when="1862-09-05"
                    >September 5th</date>. He was then suffering from partial hemiplegia, with
                mental hebetude. There was great tumefaction of the scalp. It was found that the
                right parietal was very extensively fractured, (<hi rend="initialcap">F</hi>IG. 2,)
                one fissure running near the temporo-parietal suture, and others upwards and
                backwards from the ear. Near the parietal eminence there was a marked depression. It
                was determined to raise the depressed bone, and on <date type="operation"

                    Assistant Surgeon J. W. Williams</name> applied the trephine, and, after
                removing a button and several fragments of bone, he excised a sharp depressed angle
                by a Hey's saw. It was ascertained that the dura mater had been injured by the
                sabre-cuts. After the elevation of the depressed fracture, the paralysis of the left
                side was relieved. The head was shaven, and cold applications were perseveringly
                employed. For ten days subsequently the case appeared to progress favorably; but, on
                    <date when="1862-09-14">September 14th</date>, the patient began to be heavy and
                drowsy, and the following day there were clonic spasms of the left side and
                pleurosthotonos. At night the breathing was stertorous, the pupils were dilated, and
                the general symptoms of compression of the brain were very marked. Death took place
                on <date type="death" when="1862-09-16">September 16th, 1862</date>. There was a
                large coagulum of extravasated blood under the scalp near the vertex, as though the
                man had fallen upon his head after being wounded. A <hi rend="italic">post
                    mortem</hi> examination was made on <date type="autopsy" when="1862-09-17"

                </choice>, which was remarkable for its extreme thinness, it was found that the dura
                mater was perforated beneath the intersection of the wounds, and that, for a space
                of several inches, there was thickening, with other evidences of inflammatory
                action. The arachnoid and pia mater were disintegrated in this vicinity, and a space
                comprising nearly half of the right cerebral hemisphere was occupied by an abscess.
