                <p>And your petitioner prays the said Commissioners to investigate and determine the validity of <seg type="handwritten">her</seg> said claim to the service or labor of said <seg type="handwritten"><persName>Minty Matthews</persName></seg> herein above set forth; and if the same be found to be valid, that they appraise and apportion the value of said claim in money, and report the same to the Secretary of the Treasury of the <placeName>United States</placeName>, in conformity to the provisions of said act of Congress.</p>
