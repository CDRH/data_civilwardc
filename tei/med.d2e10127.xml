     Kendall</name>, <name type="organization" key="429">Co. K, 5th Wisconsin</name>, aged 34 years,
    was wounded in the right thigh during the assault on the heights of <name type="BATTLE" key="xx"
     >Fredericksburg</name>, <date type="injury" when="1863-05-03">May 3, 1863</date>, and entered

     Sheldon</name>, <name type="organization" key="132">U. S. V.</name>, reported his discharge
    from service <date type="servicedischarge" when="1864-05-03">May 3, 1864</date>, by reason of
    "shot fracture of right femur," and at an examination on <date type="pension" when="1866-07-02"
     >July 2, 1866</date>, <name type="person" key="872">Surgeon J. H. Baxter</name>, <name
     type="organization" key="132">U. S. V.</name>, described the man as "suffering from the effects
    of an excision of nearly five inches of the femur." On <date type="photo" when="1867-11-06"
     >November 6, 1867</date>, the pensioner, who then held the appointment of clerk in the <name
     type="organization" key="449">Quartermaster General's Office</name>, visited the <name
     type="hospital" key="431">Army Medical Museum</name>, when the photograph, represented in the
    annexed cut (<hi rend="initialcap">F</hi>IG. 169), was taken. The following information in
    regard to his case was elicited from his statements: "He was wounded by a musket ball, which
    split upon the shaft of the femur, a portion of the missile lodging in the cylinder of the bone
    and a portion traversing the thigh and making its exit posteriorly. He was conveyed on a
    stretcher to a house in <name type="place">Fredericksburg</name>, and on <date type="admit"
     when="1863-05-04">the following morning</date> to the Sixth Corps Hospital on <name
     type="place">Falmouth Heights</name>. On <date type="transfer" when="1867-05-10">May
     10th</date>, he was sent on the cars to <name type="place">Aquia Creek</name>, and thence on a
    hospital transport to <name type="place" key="#Washington">Washington</name>. The injured limb
    was suspended by Smith's anterior splint. There was intense irritative fever, with copious
    suppuration. On <date type="operation" when="1863-05-21">May 21st</date>, <name type="person"
     key="327">Acting Assistant Surgeon F. W. Kelly</name> made a long incision on the posterior
    aspect of the thigh, removed a fragment of ball and numerous detached pieces of bone, and turned
    out and sawed off the sharp extremities of the fractured shaft. The limb was then supported in a
    wooden trough by cushions. The surgical fever and suppuration gradually abated, and ultimately
    firm union took place and the wound healed. Abscesses formed several times after his discharge
    from hospital, and bits of necrosed bone were eliminated. The sinuses did not close definitely
    until August, 1868." At the time of his visit to <name type="hospital" key="431">the
     Museum</name> the cicatrices were in a sound condition, and the fracture appeared firmly
    consolidated, having resulted in two and a half inches shortening of the limb and false
    anchylosis of the knee. His general health was excellent, and, notwithstanding the stiffness of
    his knee, he walked briskly with only a slight limp, injury this pensioner has been exempted
    from examinations. The pensioner was paid <date type="pension" when="1878-12-04">December 4,
     1878</date>. </p>
