There were slight pleuritic adhesions on both sides, but the parenchyma of the lungs appeared healthy. On the anterior surface of the heart was a small, oblong, semi-cartilaginous patch, with fimbriated edges; it did not involve the muscular walls. The stomach and duodenum appeared healthy. The upper third of the ileum was injected; the lower two-thirds were intensely congested, and the mucous membrane much softened. The colon presented patches of inflammation, but there were no ulcers. The liver and spleen were normal. The kidneys were slightly enlarged; the cortical substance was cream-colored, the pyramids natural.&#8212;<name type="person" key="174">Acting Assistant Surgeon N.
