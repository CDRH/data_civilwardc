                                        sick for two weeks. Diagnosis&#8212;typhoid fever. He
                                        was partly unconscious and unable to speak except
                                        occasionally; the face was congested, the eyes slightly
                                        injected, the facial muscles disturbed and those of the
                                        extremities twitching involuntarily in almost choreic
                                        movements; he had headache and some laryngeal trouble; the
                                        skin was soft and moist; the pulse 88, firm; the abdomen
                                        tender. Camphor and opium were given. Next day he was partly
                                        comatose, his face congested, pulse 100, full and strong,
                                        skin hot and soft; no stool was passed, but the abdomen was
                                        tympanitic and tender; no urine was voided for sixteen
                                        hours; the muscular twitchings continued, and the patient
                                        was unable to open his mouth or speak. Emulsion of
                                        turpentine, sweet spirit of nitre, valerian and Dover's
                                        powder were ordered. On October 1 sordes appeared on the
                                        teeth, the tongue was coated dark brown and the mouth filled
                                        with dark tenacious mucus; the patient was indifferent, but
                                        ate food when offered to him; the bowels were unmoved. Five
                                        grains each of calomel and jalap, with twelve of quinine,
                                        were given him. One small stool was obtained next day, and
                                        the patient was less stupid; he was very deaf, but answered
                                        questions correctly when put to him in a loud voice. On the
                                        3d he protruded his tongue with less difficulty and the
                                        choreic movements were lessened, but there was some
                                        dysphagia and the stools were passed involuntarily. On the
                                        4th he was rational; the tongue slightly moist; bowels tender and moved
                                        once, but not tympanitic. Turpentine emulsion, brandy,
                                        Fowler's solution and Epsom salt were given. Two involuntary
                                        stools were passed on the 6th, but the dysphagia was
                                        lessened, the twitchings had ceased and the patient was able
                                        to articulate well and masticate his food. Beef-essence and
                                        astringents were ordered. Some headache and delirium were
                                        present on the 8th; the tongue was dry and tremulous,
                                        showing yellow patches and prominent papill&#230;, and
                                        the bowels were loose. After this the skin was usually hot
                                        and dry or of the natural temperature, although on the 18th
                                        there was some perspiration at night. The tongue was moist,
                                        clean or patched with white or yellow, and usually flabby
                                        and with prominent papill&#230;; but on the 13th it was
                                        red at the tip and edges and coated yellow in the centre.
                                        The appetite was good, and for several days was recorded as
                                        excessive. The bowels were loose, yielding two or three
                                        passages daily, with occasional tympanites and tenderness
                                        mostly in the right iliac region, he slept well, but was
                                        occasionally troubled with a little cough. Epistaxis
                                        occurred on the 30th, and on November 1, 5 and 6 there was
                                        some headache with dizziness and twitchings of the eyeballs.
