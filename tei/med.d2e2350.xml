     morning of <date type="operation" when="1862-12-19">December 19th</date> there was a slight hæmorrhage from the wound. Search was made for
     the ball without result. A counter opening was made and a seton inserted. He remained very
     comfortable until <date type="operation" when="1862-12-22">the 22d</date> instant, when a severe hæmorrhage occurred, which necessitated
     the tying of the femoral in the ward, by <name type="person" key="156">Dr. Antisell</name>. On
     Sunday, January 4, 1863, there occurred a hæmorrhage which was arrested by means of
     styptics and compression. Another hæmorrhage followed on the evening of <date type="operation" when="1863-01-07">January 7th</date>, which
     could not be controlled by styptics. Search was made for the bleeding vessel without result.
     The patient lost much blood. On the following morning, <date type="operation" when="1863-01-08">January 8th</date>, the patient was again
     brought into the operating room and the wound was carefully explored, but the bleeding vessel
     was not found. The operation of tying the external iliac artery was then performed by <name type="person" key="156">Dr. Antisell</name>, in the hope of arresting the hæmorrhage
     permanently. The operation was no sooner completed than there was a welling up of blood from
     the point from which the previous hæmorrhage had proceeded. Styptics and compression were
     applied, and the patient was returned to the <choice><orig>barrack</orig><reg>barracks</reg></choice>. Stimulants and beef-tea were freely
     given, and warmth was applied to the extremities to restore reaction. He revived toward
     evening, and remained sensible and quite comfortable until the evening of the 10th instant. He
     died <date type="death" when="1863-01-11">January 11, 1863</date>, from exhaustion."  </p>
