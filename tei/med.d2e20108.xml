      Burbridge</name>, <name type="organization" key="498">Co. K, 88th Pennsylvania</name>, aged 40
     years, was wounded at <name type="BATTLE" key="3"><choice><orig>Spottsylvania</orig><reg>Spotsylvania</reg></choice></name>, <date type="injury" when="1864-05-10">May 10, 1864</date>, and entered <name type="hospital" key="165">Mount Pleasant Hospital</name>, Washington, <date type="admit" when="1864-05-13">three days afterwards</date>.
      <name type="person" key="339">Assistant Surgeon C. A. McCall</name>, <name type="organization" key="190">U. S. A.</name>, reported: "The injury was caused by a minié ball entering at the internal malleolus of the right leg, comminuting the fibular extremity and the <choice><orig>astragalus</orig><reg>talus</reg></choice> and
     laying bare the tendon. The parts became swollen, tense, and discolored, and synovitis was
     fully developed. Amputation at the junction of the middle and lower thirds of the leg was
     performed by the antero-posterior flap method on <date type="operation" when="1864-05-24">May 24th</date>, by <name type="person" key="1300">Acting Assistant Surgeon P. C. Potter</name>. The anæsthetic was made up of two parts
     chloroform and one part ether. At the time of the operation the patient was in a weak and
     debilitated condition and failing hourly, suffering from nervous trembling, restlessness,
     exhausting insomnia, and severe pain, which was lancinating and at times grinding and
     unsupportable. There was also copious discharge of ichor from the wound, and a sinus and
     abscess had extended up the limb and was opened <date type="operation" when="1864-05-22">a day or two before the operation</date>. Interrupted
     sutures were applied to the stump, which broke out from ulceration of the flaps on the third
     day. Straps were then used and a tendency to slough counteracted by antiseptic poultices.
     Tonics and malt drinks were administered. By June 30th, the sloughing had stopped and abundant
     granulations were springing up. The greatest point of difficulty in this case was produced by
     the flaps falling asunder at each dressing, thus breaking up the nearly healed union and
     allowing the tibia to protrude." In <date type="transfer" when="1864-07">the following month</date> the patient was transferred to <name type="place">York</name>,
      and subsequently he passed through various hospitals at <name type="place">Philadelphia</name>, being ultimately
       discharged from service at <name type="place">Chester</name>, <date type="servicedischarge" when="1865-06-27">June
      27,1865</date>, and pensioned.  He had been previously supplied with an artificial leg. In his
        application for commutation, dated <date type="pension" when="1870">1870</date>, the pensioner described the stump as being "tender;"
     but in his subsequent statements he represented it in "good condition." The pensioner was paid
