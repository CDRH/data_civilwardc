The patient was very feeble and restless; he had a severe cough, pain in the right side and hurried respiration; his

                                        from its right ventricle into the pulmonary artery. The
                                        liver was enlarged and contained some encysted bird-shot;
                                        the spleen also was much enlarged. The mucous membrane of
                                        the stomach was inflamed. Peritoneal adhesions bound all the
