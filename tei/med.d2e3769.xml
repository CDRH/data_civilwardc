      Hunt</name>, <name type="organization" key="374">Co. G, 57th New York</name>, aged 42 years,

     the patient was transferred to Camden Street Hospital, <name type="place" key="xx">Baltimore</name>, and on <date type="transfer" when="1864-10-23">October 23d</date> he entered Mower Hospital, <name
      type="place" key="xx">Philadelphia</name>, where <name type="person" key="xx">Acting Assistant Surgeon F. W. Saunders</name> recorded the following: &#34;A mini&#233; ball entered
     the thigh at the inner side, upper third, and, passing backward and outward behind the femur,
     emerged just below the tuberosity of the ischium. Deficient circulation from ligature or
     otherwise of the great trunks occasioned mortification in the foot, rendering necessary the
     amputation, previous to admission, on <date type="operation" when="1864-09-05">September 5th</date>, of the first and second toes at the second
     joints.&#34; The patient was subsequently transferred to McDougall Hospital, <name type="place" key="xx">New York Harbor</name>, whence he was discharged <date type="servicedischarge"

     been gangrenous; extensive cicatrix remaining, causing great contraction of muscles; little use
     of leg.&#34; On <date type="pension" when="1866-06-01">June 1, 1866</date>, the pensioner was supplied with a supporting and extensor apparatus
     by <name type="person" key="xx">Dr. E. D. Hudson</name>, of <name type="place">New York</name>, who in his statement
     reports the ligation as having been performed on &#34;July 9.&#34; The <name type="organization"
      key="xx">New York City Examining Board</name> certified, <date type="pension" when="1875-12-08">
       December 8, 1875</date>: &#34;There is a
     cicatrix five inches by four on inner side of left thigh, middle third, which is adherent and
     radiated. The femoral artery has been cut and tied. There is great loss of muscular substance.
     The great and second toes have sloughed away; foot poorly nourished. Has to wear an artificial
     appliance to enable him to walk. There is considerable atrophy of muscles of the limb. The
     disability is equal to the loss of the limb.&#34; The pensioner was paid <date type="pension" when="1876-03-04">
