                                was admitted <date type="admit" when="1863-02-07">Feb. 7, 1863</date>, with debility and diarrh&#339;a
                                        consequent on typhoid fever and measles.  He improved under
                                        treatment and was able to be out of bed most of the day
                                        when, on <date type="injury" when="1863-03-11">March 11</date>, he complained of sore throat and in the
                                        evening diphtheritic exudation had already occurred,
                                        although difficulty in swallowing and the return of liquids
                                        through the nose were not manifested until the following day.
                                        On <date type="operation" when="1863-03-13">the 13th</date> respiration was quite laborious, the tonsils
                                        much swollen and the surrounding parts covered with false
                                        membrane which nearly closed the fauces. Some of this was
                                        removed by forceps with temporary relief; but towards
                                        evening suffocation again threatened and a second attempt
                                        was made, without success, to clear the throat. The feeble
                                        condition of the patient did not warrant the administration
                                        of nauseants. He was treated with quinine and tincture of
                                        iron, which latter was also applied to the fauces.  He died on
