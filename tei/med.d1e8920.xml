                ball which struck the forehead near the left frontal eminence, denuding the bone of
                its periosteum for about one inch. He was conveyed to <name type="place"
                    key="#Washington">Washington</name>, and admitted into <name type="hospital"
                    key="173">Harewood Hospital</name> on <date type="admit" when="1863-11-09">the
                    9th</date>, complaining of slight headache over the region of the eyes. His
                pulse was normal, and his appetite poor. On the 17th, chills, with vomiting,
                supervened, and the eyes became lachrymose. These symptoms continued until <date
                    type="operation" when="1863-11-19">the 19th</date>, when he was
                an&#230;sthetized, and <name type="person" key="158">Surgeon R. B. Bontecou</name>,
                    <name type="organization" key="132">U. S. V.</name>, made a crucial incision
                through the scalp, when pus was found issuing through the denuded bone. The trephine
                was then applied near the left frontal eminence, giving exit to a small quantity of
                pus, which was found between the dura mater and the skull. After the operation, the
                patient became free from pain. During the night of the 20th, he became delirious,
                and lay in a stupor nearly all the time, but answered questions correctly. The next
                morning, the forehead and right eye-lids were &#339;dematous, and the pulse was 75,
                and feeble. On the 23d, low muttering delirium followed, coma ensued, the alvine
                evacuations became involuntary, and his breathing stertorous. At eleven o'clock A.
                M. of <date type="operation" when="1863-11-24">the 24th</date>, the dura mater was
                incised, giving exit to a small quantity of pus, but no relief was afforded, and
                death occurred <date type="death" when="1863-11-24">two hours subsequently</date>.
                The pathological specimen was sent to the <name type="hospital" key="431">Army
