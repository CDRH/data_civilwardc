Diarrhœa and pneumonia.  This man had watery, offensive stools; feeble, rapid pulse; dusky, anxious countenance; labored respiration; dry, dark, thickly coated tongue; low delirium, and considerable stupor. There was marked <choice><orig>dulness</orig><reg>dullness</reg></choice> on percussion over the left side of the chest, but with little crepitation; on the right side small crepitation was heard. The expectoration was scanty and difficult at first, but was fairly established under the use of a combination of fluid extract of ipecacuanha, bicarbonate of soda, and sulphate of morphia. Stimulants and beef-tea were administered from the first.  Died, <date type="death" when="1865-02-07">February 7th</date>.  <hi rend="italic">Autopsy</hi> <date type="death" when="1865-02-08">sixteen hours after death</date>: The superior lobe of the right lung was found to be completely consolidated, while the middle and lower lobes were collapsed and but slightly engorged. The superior lobe of the left lung was apparently healthy, and the upper third of the lower lobe was hepatized; the remaining portion was but slightly congested, and readily floated in water. The other organs of the chest were apparently healthy, and nothing abnormal was observed in any portion of the intestinal canal.—<name type="person" key="221">Acting Assistant Surgeon George P. Hanawalt</name>.</p>
