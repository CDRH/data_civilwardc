     colored servant of the <name type="organization" key="355">58th Pennsylvania Volunteers</name>,
     aged 13 years, was wounded at <name type="BATTLE" key="263">Cold Harbor</name>, <date type="injury" when="1864-06-03">June 3, 1864</date>, by a minié ball, which entered on the
     inner side of the lower third of the right thigh, passed through the popliteal space, injuring
     the popliteal artery, and making its exit latterly. <date type="admit" when="1864-06-15">Twelve days after</date> the reception of the
     injury he was admitted to <name type="hospital" key="173">Harewood Hospital</name>, Washington.
     Hæmorrhage to the amount of from three to five ounces took place on June 25th, and was
     controlled by pressure. On <date type="operation" when="1864-06-26">the following day</date> hæmorrhage recurred, and the popliteal artery
     was ligated by <name type="person" key="158">Surgeon R. B. Bontecou</name>, <name type="organization" key="132">U. S. V.</name>, by enlarging the wound of entrance, the patient
     being under the influence of sulphuric ether. The leg was placed in Smith's anterior splint
     with a fenestra opposite the wound to facilitate dressing, and a supporting treatment was
     ordered. The patient exhibited typhoid symptoms with very profuse diarrhœa until death,
     which occurred <date type="death" when="1864-07-03">July 3, 1864</date>. An autopsy showed that
     the coats of the artery had been injured by the ball, causing sloughing and the subsequent
     hæmorrhage. The history was reported by the operator.  </p>
