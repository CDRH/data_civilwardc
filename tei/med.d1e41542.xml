   <p>Case from the case-book of the <name type="hospital" key="501"><hi rend="initialcap">T</hi>HIRD <hi rend="initialcap">D</hi>IVISION</name> of the <name type="place" key="#Alexandria"><hi rend="initialcap">A</hi>LEXANDRIA</name> <hi rend="initialcap">H</hi>OSPITAL, <name type="person" key="134">Surgeon Edwin Bentley</name>, <name type="organization" key="132">U. S. V.</name>, in charge:&#8432;</p>
   <p><hi rend="initialcap">C</hi>ASE 491.&#8212;<name type="person" key="xxx">Private Stephen Benson</name>, <name type="organization" key="xxx">company F, 7th Michigan cavalry</name>; age 25; admitted <date type="admit" when="1863-07-19">July 19, 1863</date>.  Chronic diarrh&#339;a.  This patient presented every symptom of a confirmed lunatic, and it was stated by men of his regiment that he was idiotic when enlisted. He was very much debilitated; had suffered from diarrh&#339;a for nearly five months; his pulse was 100 and feeble, and he labored under incontinence of urine.  Treatment: Tonics and astringents; a blister over the abdomen. The diarrh&#339;a was checked for a time, but dropsy made its appearance, and subsequently the flux returned in an aggravated form.  Died, <date type="death" when="1863-11-02">November 2d</date>.  <hi rend="italic">Autopsy</hi> <date type="autopsy" when="1863-11-02">eight hours after death</date>: The body was &#339;dematous. There were slight pleuritic adhesions on the left side. The lungs were healthy. The heart was slightly enlarged. The liver was congested. The spleen was much enlarged and congested, weighing three pounds ten ounces. The lower portion of the ileum was thickened, but no ulcers were observed.   [There is no record of the condition of the large intestine.]</p> 
   <p>&#8432; It is to be regretted that, in most instances, the records of this hospital do not show by whom the autopsies were made. It is known that many of them were made by <name type="person" key="134">Surgeon Bentley</name> himself, or under his immediate supervision, but it is only possible to distinguish these from the others in a few cases.</p>
