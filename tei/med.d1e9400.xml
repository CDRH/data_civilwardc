                        James B. Perkins</name>, <name type="organization" key="614">Co H, 20th
                            Connecticut Volunteers</name>, aged 23 years, was wounded at the battle of <name type="BATTLE" key="10">Chancellorsville, Virginia</name>, <date type="injury" when="1863-05-03">May 3d, 1863</date>, by a musket ball which
                    fractured the frontal bone an inch above the right eye and lodged in the frontal
                    sinus.  He was taken prisoner, but was paroled on May 10th, and admitted <date type="admit" when="1863-05-12">two days
                    subsequently</date> into the field hospital of the Twelfth Corps. He was transferred to
                        <name type="hospital" key="214">Fairfax Seminary hospital</name> on <date type="transfer" when="1863-06-14">June 14th</date>, and thence to
                    <name type="place">Philadelphia</name> on <date type="transfer" when="1863-06-17">the 17th</date>, and
                    admitted into <name type="hospital">Mower Hospital</name>.  On the 28th an examination of the wound revealed
                    the external table denuded and slightly depressed.  On July 10th the wound was
                    discharging healthy pus, and on August 5th had closed, except an opening half an
                    inch wide.  On November 23d he had sufficiently recovered to be placed on guard
                    duty in the hospital.  On <date type="operation" when="1863-12-08">December 8th</date> a slight swelling over the right frontal
                    protuberance was observed. The probe detected small loose fragments of bone. <name type="person" key="419">Acting Assistant Surgeon J. M. McGrath</name>
                    made a straight incision an inch in length, extending from the fistulous orifice
                    over the superciliary ridge. The outer table of the skull was found destroyed,
                    and a musket ball almost completely divided through its centre and spread open,
                    was discovered partially imbedded in the frontal sinus. The missile, together
                    with several fragments of bone, was removed by forceps. The wound was closed by
                    adhesive strips, and cold water dressings were applied.  The patient improved
                    gradually, and by January 18th, 1864, the wound had healed except at a small
                    opening through which there was a slight discharge of healthy pus.  On <date type="transfer" when="1864-03-31">March 31st</date> he was transferred to
                    <name type="place">New Haven</name> to the Knight Hospital, whence he was returned to duty on <date type="duty" when="1864-05-07">May 7th, 1864</date>.   The case is reported by
                        <name type="person" key="403">Surgeon Joseph Hopkinson</name>, <name type="organization" key="132">U. S. V.</name>  The name of this patient is
                    not upon the rolls of the Pension Office. </p>
