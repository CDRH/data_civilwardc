      Artillery</name>, recorded his admission to the field hospital of the 1st division, Second Corps, with "shot wound of left knee, caused by a mini&#233;
     ball." <name type="person" key="243">Assistant Surgeon J. C. McKee</name>, <name
      type="organization" key="190">U. S. A.</name>, who contributed the pathological specimen of the case (<hi rend="italic">Cat. Surg. Sect.</hi>, 1866, p. 343, <hi
      rend="italic">Spec</hi>. 2538), reported the result of the injury as follows: "The wounded man
     entered <name type="hospital" key="176">Lincoln Hospital</name>, Washington, <date type="transfer" when="1864-05-30">May 30th</date>. He was a
     man of nervous and irritable temperament. When admitted he suffered from much constitutional
     derangement, and the tissues in the neighborhood of the injured joint were much enlarged,
     tender, and painful. Cold-water dressings were used, and tonics and stimulants were
     administered. On <date type="operation" when="1864-06-13">June 13th</date>, the parts above and below the knee joint being infiltrated with pus
     and discharging copiously through several openings, amputation was decided upon, and performed at the middle third of the femur by <name
      type="person" key="709">Acting Assistant Surgeon A. Ansell</name>, as the only chance of saving the
     patient's life. On examining the injured parts after the operation the missile was found to
     have passed through the joint, comminuting the patella and knocking away the head of the tibia
     on its inner side. The subsequent treatment consisted of cold-water dressings to the stump and the administration of six ounces
     of brandy per diem; one grain of sulphate of morphia was given at bedtime after the operation.
     Iron and quinine were prescribed some days afterwards. The patient did exceedingly well, and
     the stump healed kindly, the cicatrix forming perfectly with the exception of one small opening, which served as an outlet for a small abscess about the size of a pigeon's egg.
     H&#230;morrhage took place from this part of the stump on July 18th, when the tourniquet was
     applied to the femoral artery, which had the effect of arresting the flow of blood. A plug of
     lint saturated with a solution of persulphate of iron was then introduced into the wound and
     the tourniquet removed. H&#230;morrhage occurred again on the morning of <date type="operation" when="1864-07-19">the following day</date>,
     when, on consultation, it was decided to open the stump and ligate the bleeding vessel. This
     was also done by <name type="person" key="709">Dr. Ansell</name>, who tied the femoral as well
     as two muscular arteries, which had been opened by the incision. The operation was performed at
     11.30 A. M., and the patient died at 6 P. M. on the same day, <date type="death"
      when="1864-07-19">July 19, 1864</date>, not having rallied, and having lost altogether about
     twenty ounces of blood. The interior of the stump was found to be perfectly healthy, with the
     exception of the small abscess before mentioned." The specimen consists of the bones of the
     amputated knee, showing the articular surface to be carious, and a longitudinal incomplete
     fracture extending between the condyles two and a half inches up the femur, on the shaft of
     which two trivial points of periosteal thickening appear. The stump of the femur, showing a
     partially detached sequestrum and handsome but useless foliaceous deposit, together with a wet
     preparation of the ligated femoral artery, were also contributed to <name type="hospital"
      key="431">the Museum</name> by <name type="person" key="246">Acting Assistant Surgeon H. M.
      Dean</name>, and constitute specimens 2882 and 2883 of the Surgical Section.</p>
