The upper portion of the rectum was reddened, and presented numerous spots of ecchymosis; the lower two-thirds of the rectum were thickened, very dark-colored, and were the seat of numerous deep ulcers, most of which had penetrated through the mucous coat and several through the muscular coat; a large ascaris lumbricoides escaped from the intestines whilst a stream of water was being passed through them, so that it was impossible to ascertain from what portion it came. The bladder was distended with dark-colored urine.—<name type="person" key="208">Acting Assistant Surgeon Carlos Carvallo</name>.</p>
