     Esworthy</name>, <name type="organization" key="344">Co. E, 1st Pennsylvania Cavalry</name>,
    aged 24 years, was wounded in the left leg at <name type="BATTLE" key="61">White House
     Landing</name>, <date type="injury" when="1864-06-21">June 21, 1864</date>, and admitted to
     <name type="hospital" key="167">Carver Hospital</name>, Washington, <date type="admit" when="1864-06-23">two days afterwards</date>. <name type="person" key="102">Surgeon O. A.
     Judson</name>, <name type="organization" key="132">U. S. V.</name>, reported: "The missile,
    supposed to be a conoidal ball, entered the leg anteriorly about three inches below the knee
    joint, passed backward and outward, making its exit posteriorly and producing a compound
    comminuted fracture of the upper third of the tibia. Supporting treatment was adopted and simple
    dressings applied. Erysipelas attacked the wound on June 27th, but yielded readily to an
    application of solution of copperas. By July 1st no erysipelatous symptoms were present;
    constitutional state of patient good; wound secreting laudable pus in large quantity. On <date type="operation" when="1864-07-06">July 6th</date>, the patient was anæsthetized and
    excision of about five inches of the upper third of the shaft of the tibia, by means of the
    chain saw, was performed by <name type="person" key="589">Acting Assistant Surgeon O. P.
     Sweet</name>, making a straight incision over the crest of the tibia. The wound was then filled
    with scraped lint, cold-water dressings were applied, and stimulants given freely. The patient
    appeared to be doing quite well up to <date type="injury" when="1864-07-18">July 18th</date>,
    the wound filling with healthy granulations and secreting laudable pus. For ten days previous,
    however, he had anorexia, and this morning he had a very severe chill. A recurrence of chills
    followed every morning and sometimes two or three times during the day, and these were followed
    by other pyæmic symptoms, the integuments assuming a deep icteric tinge; pulse rapid;
    slight cough; anorexia continuing. The treatment, decidedly stimulating and tonic, was
    continued. The symptoms continued in a more aggravated form and the patient steadily sank, the
    whole surface of his body being of a deep yellow color. He died on <date type="death" when="1864-07-23">July 23, 1864</date>. At the autopsy a large number of metastatic abscesses
    were found in both lungs; liver enlarged; spleen also enlarged, dark colored, and soft. A
    purulent offensive fluid mixed with lymph was shown in the left pleural cavity, and a large
    disintegrated clot in the femoral vein." The excised bone, contributed by <name type="person" key="102">Surgeon Judson</name> and exhibiting superficial necrosis, is represented in the
    wood-cut (<hi rend="initialcap">F</hi>IG. 280).</p>
