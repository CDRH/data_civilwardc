Crane</name>, <name type="organization" key="xxx">company D, 1st Maine cavalry</name>; admitted <date type="admit" when="1863-08-18">August 18, 1863</date>.  Chronic diarrh&#339;a.

The brain was firm, and weighed fifty-four ounces; the pia mater was injected, particularly on the external side of the left hemisphere. The lateral ventricles contained half a drachm of clear serum slightly tinged with blood. The mucous membrane of the upper portion of the &#339;sophagus was pale, toward the cardiac orifice it was darker colored. The mucous membrane of the upper portion of the trachea was pale, lower down it was purplish between the rings. The bronchial gland at the bifurcation of the trachea contained a calcareous deposit. The right lung weighed twelve ounces and a half, the left ten ounces; both lungs were congested. The pericardium contained a drachm and a half of fluid. The heart weighed eight ounces; its valves were healthy; the right auricle was filled with a soft black clot, which extended into the right ventricle and thence into the pulmonary artery; there were no clots on the left side. The liver was of a light-purple color, its acini well marked, its capsule readily torn; it weighed sixty-seven ounces; the gall-bladder contained eight drachms of dark greenish-brown bile. The spleen was very firm, of a liver-color on section, and weighed five ounces and a half. The pancreas was pale but healthy, and weighed two ounces and a half. The right kidney weighed four ounces; weight of the left not recorded; both were slightly congested, their capsules readily torn, their pelves pale. The suprarenal capsules were lighter externally than internally, and of a brownish-ochre color. The mucous membrane of the stomach was firm and of a grayish color. The small intestine was healthy, except in its lower third, where the mucous membrane was congested. The mucous membrane of the large intestine presented a ragged appearance, due to the irregular distribution of a diphtheritic exudation; this was of a light-greenish color, and lay in a thick layer on the surface; those portions of the membrane which were not covered by the exudation presented an angry inflamed appearance and minute ecchymosed spots.&#8212;<name type="person" key="245">Assistant Surgeon Harrison Allen</name>, <name type="organization" key="190">U. S. A.</name>&#8432;</p>
   <p>&#8432; September 14, 1864, <name type="person" key="245">Dr. Allen</name> presented to the Pathological Society of Philadelphia a brief &#34;<hi rend="italic">Synopsis of Autopsies made at <name type="hospital" key="176">Lincoln General Hospital</name></hi>,&#34; to which the reader is referred.&#8212;(Proceedings of the Pathological Society of Philadelphia, in the American Journal of the Medical Sciences, January, 1865, page 133.)  In this paper he analyzes the appearances observed in forty-one cases of diarrh&#339;a and dysentery, thirty-five of fever, twenty-one of pneumonia, and five of diphtheria. The notes of <name type="person" key="245">Dr. Allen</name>'s autopsies, from which the accounts here presented have been condensed, were not contained in the case-books of <name type="hospital" key="176">Lincoln hospital</name> turned in to the <name type="organization" key="xxx">Surgeon General's Office</name> at the close of the war, but have since been copied into them from the originals, loaned for the purpose.</p>
