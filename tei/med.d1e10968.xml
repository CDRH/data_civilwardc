                                and admitted <date type="admit" when="1862-03-02">March 2</date>.  Diagnosis: Typhoid fever.  4th: Drowsy;
                                        cheeks flushed; pulse full, weak and rapid; skin hot and
                                        dry; some deafness; tongue coated; much thirst; two watery
                                        stools daily; much cough with mucous expectoration. Gave
                                        stimulants, iron and turpentine emulsion.  6th: Tongue moist;
                                        no abdominal tenderness; cough lessened; appetite
                                        returning; bowels regular.  He continued thus until the 10th,
                                        when the record shows some delirium at night, epistaxis and
                                        dry tongue. In answering questions he confused his dreams
                                        with realities, and for some days afterward had curious
                                        hallucinations. His appetite continued good and his bowels
                                        regular, but the pulse remained quick and weak.  On the 16th
                                        his cheeks became much flushed; he had severe pain in the
                                        right breast and was unable to breathe deeply, to
                                        cough or to lie down.  17th: Replies rationally, but at once
                                        relapses into delirium; pulse rapid, soft; skin natural;
                                        tongue moist, slightly coated; appetite poor; bowels
                                        regular; some deafness; much epigastric tenderness and
                                        severe pain in chest. Applied fly-blister over summit of
