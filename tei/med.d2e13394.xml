     Hammill</name>, <name type="organization" key="90">Co. D, 8th New Jersey</name>, aged 23 years,
    was wounded in the right knee, at <name type="BATTLE" key="10">Chancellorsville</name>, <date type="injury" when="1863-05-03">May 3, 1863</date>. From the field he was conveyed to Potomac
    Creek Hospital, and thence, <date type="transfer" when="1863-06">six weeks afterwards</date>, to
     <name type="place" key="#Washington">Washington</name>, where the injured limb was amputated.
     <name type="person" key="123">Surgeon D. W. Bliss</name>, <name type="organization" key="132">U. S. V.</name>, who performed the operation, reported: "The wound was caused by a minié
    ball, which struck the external condyle of the femur and passed directly through, comminuting
    the condyles and lower part of the femur and opening the joint. The patient was admitted to
     <name type="hospital" key="171">Armory Square Hospital</name>, <date type="admit" when="1863-06-14">June 14th</date>. He was then suffering from profuse suppuration from the
    joint, and had a large abscess attended with disintegration of the tissues of the calf of the
    leg, in consequence of which he was in a very reduced condition. There were no symptoms of
    pyæmia, however. As there was no possible chance of life for the patient without an
    operation, it was decided to amputate, which was done on <date type="operation" when="1863-06-16">June 16th</date>, by the circular method, at the junction of the middle and
    upper thirds. The soft parts were found in a very diseased condition. The patient stood the
    operation well and progressed favorably. <date type="transfer" when="1863-09">Three months
     afterwards</date> he was transferred to <name type="hospital" key="160">St. Elizabeth
     Hospital</name>." The man was ultimately discharged from Ward Hospital, <name type="place">Newark</name>, <date type="servicedischarge" when="1864-05-04">May 4, 1864</date>, having been
    previously furnished with an artificial limb by <name type="person" key="xx">E. D.
    Hudson</name>, of <name type="place" key="xx">New York City</name>. He is a pensioner, and was
    paid <date type="pension" when="1878-06-04">June 4, 1878</date>. The amputated part of the
    femur, together with the bones of the knee, were contributed to <name type="hospital" key="431">the Museum</name> by <name type="person" key="123">the operator</name>, and are shown in the
    cut (<hi rend="initialcap">F</hi>IG. 198). The specimen shows a slight deposit of callus on the
    border of the fracture, and much disorganization of the articulation by suppuration.</p>
