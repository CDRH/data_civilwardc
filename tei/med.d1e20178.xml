                                                  and emerged at eighth rib, below axillary space. 
                                                  H&#230;moptysis followed, which lasted for several
                                                  hours. He was treated in the field hospital of the
                                                  Fifth Corps until <date type="transfer" when="1865-04-29">April 29th</date>, when he was

                                                  When admitted, the patient suffered greatly from
                                                  dyspn&#339;a; characteristic sputa of pneumonia; lower
                                                  lobe of right lung collapsed; considerable febrile
                                                  movement; great emaciation. <date type="operation" when="1865-05-06">May 6th</date>: Upon a
                                                  careful examination, the succussion sound was
                                                  distinctly heard; the line noting the height at
                                                  which the fluid stood, while the patient was in an
                                                  upright position, was about two inches above the
                                                  right nipple. As both wounds were closed, an
                                                  incision, of a valvular nature, was made near the
                                                  wound at eighth rib, and a No. 7 gum-elastic
                                                  catheter introduced about four inches into the
                                                  cavity, pointing downward, when, by means of a
                                                  Davidson's syringe, sixty-eight ounces of pus and
                                                  serum, having an exceedingly offensive odor, was
                                                  withdrawn. The catheter was then removed and the
                                                  integument held firmly over the opening by the
                                                  atmospheric pressure, thereby preventing any
                                                  ingress of air from without. Very little pain
                                                  attended the operation, and the patient expressed
                                                  himself as feeling greatly relieved. He improved
                                                  rapidly in health, and, on <date type="hospitaldischarge" when="1865-05-26">May 26th</date>, left for his
