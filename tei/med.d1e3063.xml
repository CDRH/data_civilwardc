                                        weakness, headache, nausea and pain in the bones, and was
                                        admitted on <date type="admit" when="1861-09-05">the 5th</date> as a case of remittent fever. His tongue
                                        was flabby, white-coated and red at the edges, pulse 90,
                                        face flushed, skin moist and hot, bowels constipated. His
                                        fever was reported to be worse in the morning than in the
                                        evening. A dose of Epsom salt was followed by six large thin
                                        stools. Quinine was given. Next day he had two small stools,
                                        and on the 7th his bowels were quiet. On this day the
                                        morning pulse was 84, the evening 68, full on both
                                        occasions; and there was headache with flushed face, a pale
                                        white-coated tongue and anorexia. Dover's powder was given
                                        at night. On the 8th the morning pulse was 66, the tongue
                                        coated white in the middle, the face slightly flushed and
                                        there was some giddiness. In the evening the pulse had risen
                                        to 71, the tongue was clean, and an eruption, stated as
                                        owing to the poison of the rhus toxicodendron, appeared in
                                        confluent patches. After this he rested well and had no
                                        fever. Bicarbonate of soda was applied to the eruption,
                                        which faded in four or five days. On the 12th the patient's
                                        appetite was good and he was walking about. On the <date type="transfer" when="1861-09-13">13th</date> he was
                                        transferred to hospital at <name type="place">Baltimore, Md.</name> </p>
