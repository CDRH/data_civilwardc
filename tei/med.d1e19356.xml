        <name type="person">Private Thomas L&#8212;&#8212;</name>, <name type="organization">Co. K,
          1st Massachusetts Volunteers</name>, aged 42 years, having been wounded at <name
          type="BATTLE" key="251">Fredericksburg, Virginia</name>, on <date type="injury"
          when="1863-05-03">May 3d, 1863</date>, was sent to Washington, and admitted to <name
          type="hospital" key="167">Carver Hospital</name> on <date type="admit" when="1863-05-09"
          >the 9th</date>. An unknown missile had entered the right shoulder about two inches below
        the acromion process, and, passing backward and inward, had emerged above the inferior angle
        of the scapula. The patient's pulse was 120, and quite weak, and his skin was bathed in
        perspiration. Percussion over the right lung elicited considerable dullness. The treatment
        consisted in the frequent administration of anodynes, stimulants, and tonics, with a low
        diet. The patient suffered from anorexia and insomnia, and bloody serum was discharged
        through the posterior wound during inspiration. Air was also forced through at the same
        time. He died on the morning of <date type="death" when="1863-05-11">the 11th</date>. The
        autopsy discovered a fracture at the surgical neck of the humerus; the sixth, seventh, and
        eighth ribs were comminuted, and portions of bone were forced through the pleura, the cavity
        of which contained a large quantity of bloody serum. The scapula was also fractured, and the
        tissues surrounding the wound were much inflamed. The costal surface of the pleura was
        coated with fibrinous exudations. The pathological specimen, consisting of the right
        scapula, upper third of the humerus, and sections of the fifth, seventh, and eighth ribs,
        was contributed by <name type="person" key="102">Surgeon O. A. Judson</name>, <name
          type="organization" key="132">U. S. V.</name>, and is represented in the wood-cut (<hi
