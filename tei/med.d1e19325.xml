        <hi rend="initialcap">C</hi>ASE.—<name type="person">Sergeant Samuel
          A——</name>, <name type="organization">Co. F, 125th Pennsylvania
          Volunteers</name>, aged 40 years, was wounded at <name type="BATTLE" key="257">Chancellorsville, Virginia</name>, on <date type="injury" when="1863-05-03">May 3d,
          1863</date>, and was admitted to <name type="hospital" key="167">Carver Hospital</name>,
        Washington, on <date type="admit" when="1863-05-09">the 9th</date>. A bullet wound was found
        on the right side of the back, near the spine, and in the neighborhood of the third dorsal
        vertebra. There was a fracture of the clavicle on the same side, with considerable swelling,
        and some deformity of the shoulder. The patient had frequent cough, and bloody
        expectoration. The fracture of the clavicle was treated by a pad in the armpit and a sling,
        and the wound in the back was dressed with wet lint covered with oiled silk. Small doses of
        morphia were given, with the effect of diminishing very much the frequency of the cough. The
        patient was feeble, and the discharge from the wound considerable, but no very serious
        symptoms presented themselves until <date type="injury" when="1863-05-16">the 16th</date>,
        when the patient was seized with considerable oppression of breathing, and with pain on the
        wounded side. Dullness over the upper side of the right lung was observed on percussion. A
        discharge of blood and serum from the wound seemed to relieve the pneumonic symptoms in a
        few hours after their first occurrence. The breathing became easier, and pain was no longer
        complained of. Bleeding from the wound ceased on the 17th, but a copious discharge of serous
        pus remained, and the patient became gradually weaker, notwithstanding the free use of
        stimulants and of as much nourishment as could be administered. His sinking was slow but
        constant, and he died on the afternoon of <date type="death" when="1863-05-20">May
          20th</date>. At the autopsy, the bullet was found just below the clavicle, near its
        middle, having fractured the bone transversely after passing between the third and fourth
        ribs, and fracturing the neck of the third near its angle. The specimen figured in the
        adjoining cut (<hi rend="initialcap">F</hi>IG. 218), was presented to the <name type="hospital" key="431">Army Medical Museum</name>, with the above account, by <name type="person">Acting Assistant Surgeon B. F. Craig</name>. </p>
