Diarrh&#339;a of seven months standing. The patient was weak, emaciated, and had no appetite. He had from six to twelve passages daily.

In this condition the patient remained without further amendment until July 31st, when an enema of fifteen grains of nitrate of silver, dissolved in an ounce of water, was ordered. This was retained about an hour. From this time the evacuations became natural in appearance, and were reduced in number to one or two daily.
