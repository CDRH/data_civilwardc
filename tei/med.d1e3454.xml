                                        which day he was found to be weak, having had ten stools,
                                        with general abdominal tenderness and some retention of
                                        urine; a few rose-spots were scattered on the chest and
                                        abdomen; the face was slightly flushed, the eyes injected
                                        and suffused and their lids closed, the skin of natural
                                        temperature, pulse 80, tongue moist, red at the tip and
                                        edges, coated yellow on the dorsum, appetite deficient; he
                                        had some cough and pain in the limbs. On the 10th there was
                                        much thirst; the skin was hot and dry; four new rose-spots
                                        had appeared; the tongue was moist and flabby, red at the
                                        tip and edges and heavily coated yellow in the centre; six
                                        stools were passed. Tincture of iron was given three times
                                        daily. On the 11th the skin was covered with perspiration,
                                        the rose-spots had increased in number, the bowels were
                                        moved twice and there was tenderness at the umbilicus and in
                                        the iliac regions, markedly on the right side, with some
                                        tympanites and borborygmus. Turpentine emulsion was given
                                        every three hours. On the 12th the patient was reported as
                                        having slept well; he was dull and stupid; his eyes dull and
                                        injected; cheeks somewhat flushed; pulse 75, regular; skin
                                        hot, dry and profusely covered with rose-colored spots;
                                        tongue slightly moist, red at the tip and edges, coated
                                        yellow in the centre; lips and teeth covered with sordes;
                                        appetite poor; his bowels were moved five times, and there
                                        was much abdominal tenderness, notably about the umbilicus.
                                        Astringents were given, but the diarrh&#339;a continued.
                                        On the 15th, 16th and 17th profuse perspirations were noted,
                                        and rose-spots, perceptible to the touch, continued to
                                        erupt. A few of these spots appeared on the forehead on the
                                        22d and a few more on the chest two days later. On the 22d
                                        the diarrh&#339;a was controlled: one stool only was
                                        passed instead of three, four or more, as on previous days;
                                        but the general abdominal and extreme umbilical tenderness
                                        was not relieved until some days later. Meanwhile the tongue
                                        became clean, the skin natural and the appetite good. The
                                        cough, which had affected the patient more or less from his
                                        admission, now assumed prominence as a symptom, and was
                                        accompanied with mucous expectoration. He was transferred
