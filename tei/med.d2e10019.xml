     Fearing</name>, <name type="organization" key="428">Co. G, 21st Massachusetts</name>, aged 23
    years, received a gunshot fracture of the right thigh at <name type="BATTLE" key="16">Cold
     Harbor</name>, <date type="injury" when="1864-06-03">June 3, 1864</date>. He was admitted to
    the field hospital of the 1st division, Ninth Corps, where the operation of resection was
    performed but not recorded, and several days afterwards he was conveyed to <name type="place"
     key="#Washington">Washington</name>. <name type="person" key="1062">Acting Assistant Surgeon P.
     O. Williams</name> described the injury and its result, as follows: "The patient was admitted
    to <name type="hospital" key="172">Emory Hospital</name>, <date type="admit" when="1864-06-07"
     >June 7th</date>, with compound comminuted fracture of the femur at the upper third, caused by
    a mini&#233; ball, which entered anterior to the femoral artery, passed backward and outward,
    and emerged on the opposite side. Two and a half inches of the bone had been excised <date
     type="operation" when="1864-06-04">the day after the injury</date>, through an incision four
    inches in length. The general treatment consisted of tonics, stimulants, astringents, and
    generous diet. Pulley extension, sand bags, and bandages were applied to the limb and cold-water
    dressings to the wound. Small spicul&#230; of bone and a small piece of lead about the size of a
    pea were removed on <date type="operation" when="1864-06-30">June 30th</date>. The patient died
     <date type="death" when="1864-08-03">August 3, 1864</date>, of exhaustion resulting from the
    excessive discharge of the wound and from severe diarrh&#339;a, which had troubled him the last
    two weeks. The <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> revealed necrosis of both excised extremities,
    extending from one to one and a half inches. There was abundant deposit of osseous matter on the
    upper portion, but upon the lower part only a little was found on the posterior aspect." The
    upper half of the injured femur was contributed by <name type="person" key="884">Surgeon N. R.
     Moseley</name>, <name type="organization" key="132">U. S. V.</name>, and is shown in the cut
     (<hi rend="initialcap">F</hi>IG. 166).</p>
