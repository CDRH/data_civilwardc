   <p><hi rend="initialcap">C</hi>ASE 436.—<name type="person" key="1069">Corporal C. N.
     Lapham</name>, <name type="organization" key="433">Co. K, 1st Vermont Cavalry</name>, aged 23
    years, was wounded during the engagement near <name type="place">Boonsboro'</name>, <date type="injury" when="1863-07-08">July 8, 1863</date>, by a cannon ball, which carried away both
    legs. He was conveyed to the field hospital at <name type="place">Boonsboro'</name> where both
    limbs were amputated <date type="operation" when="1863-07-10">two days after the receipt of the
     injury</date>. <date type="hospitalservicedischarge" when="1863-11">Four months after the
     operation</date> the patient was deemed well enough to be allowed to go to his home, where he
    remained until the following year. On <date type="injury" when="1864-05-31">May 31, 1864</date>,
    he was furnished with artificial limbs by <name type="person" key="xx">Dr. E. D. Hudson</name>,
    of <name type="place" key="xx">New York City</name>, who contributed the photographs represented
    in the annexed cuts (<hi rend="initialcap">F</hi>IGS. 176, 177) and the following description of
    the operation: "The right thigh was amputated at the middle third, by the antero-posterior flap
    method, on account of great comminution of the leg involving the knee joint; the stump is healed
    and in a favorable condition. The left leg was disarticulated at the knee joint. This operation
    was also performed by antero-posterior flaps, and the stump is healed and in good condition,
    though the supporting cicatrix at the base is not good. The condyles of the femur, as a base,
    form the most useful, reliable, and comfortable support, and constitute his chief dependence,
    and the benefits of disarticulation, when compared with amputations of the thigh, are shown to
    be incalculable." The patient was discharged from Baxter Hospital, at <name type="place">Burlington, Vermont</name>, <date type="servicedischarge" when="1864-08-25">Aug. 25,
     1864</date>, and pensioned. Five months later, when a student at the <name type="organization" key="xx">Collegiate Institute</name> in <name type="place">Poughkeepsie, N. Y.</name>, he wrote
    to <name type="person" key="xx">Dr. Hudson</name> that "he could walk with ease on level ground,
    get up and down stairs readily, and was getting along much better than he anticipated in so
    short a time." Some time afterwards he obtained an appointment as clerk in the <name type="organization" key="451">U. S. Treasury Department</name> at <name type="place" key="#Washington">Washington</name>, in which occupation he is still employed. His pension was
    paid <date type="pension" when="18790-09-04">September 4, 1879</date>. In his application for
    commutation he reported that <name type="person" key="xx">Surgeon L. P. Woods</name>, <name type="organization" key="434">5th New York Cavalry</name>, was the operator who amputated his
    limbs.</p>
