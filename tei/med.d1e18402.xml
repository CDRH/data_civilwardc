                                                  by a musket ball, which entered over the left
                                                  border of the trapezius muscle, opposite to the

                                                  horse, receiving a contusion of the left arm. He

                                                  there was neuralgic pain in the arm, and
                                                  impairment of its use. He was discharged the

                                                  reports that the ball must have severed some part
                                                  of the cervical plexus of nerves, as there is
                                                  complete paralysis of arm and hand. The arm is
