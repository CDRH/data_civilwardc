                                Diagnosis—typhoid fever and chronic bronchitis. On <date when="1862-03-04">the 4th</date> he was quite deaf, drowsy
                                and delirious; he was hoarse and had a frequent cough with free
                                expectoration; his cheeks were hot and flushed, and he had much
                                thirst; pulse rapid and weak; tongue somewhat dry, quite red and
                                with enlarged papillæ; stools not frequent but loose; abdomen
                                tender. Two watery stools were passed on the 5th. The tongue became
                                moist on the 6th, the appetite returned and the bowels were quiet,
                                but the other symptoms remained unchanged. On the 7th the deafness lessened and
                                the hoarseness and cough diminished; pulse 90, good; skin natural;
                                tongue moist, fissured, clean; bowels unmoved; but the mind
                                continued affected for some time longer. On the 13th he replied naturally to questions, but had
                                curious hallucinations which returned occasionally for several days
                                after this, and the deafness continued for some days longer. During
                                this time the bowels were regular or inclined to constipation.
                                Milk-punch and tincture of iron were used. He was able to walk about
                                on <date when="1862-03-27">the 27th</date>. On <date type="servicedischarge" when="1862-04-26">April 26</date> he
                                was discharged for disability. </p>
