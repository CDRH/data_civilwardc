     Dyer</name>, <name type="organization" key="96">Co. G, 6th Maine</name>, aged 21 years, was
    wounded at <name type="BATTLE" key="262">Rappahannock Station</name>, <date type="injury"
     when="1863-11-07">November 7, 1863</date>, and was admitted to <name type="hospital" key="171"
     >Armory Square Hospital</name>, Washington, <date type="admit" when="1863-11-09">two days
     afterwards</date>. <name type="person" key="123">Surgeon D. W. Bliss</name>, <name
     type="organization" key="132">U. S. V.</name>, reported: &#34;A mini&#233; ball entered four
    inches below and in line with the trochanter major of the right thigh, took a downward and
    inward course, and could not be found on admission to the hospital. On <date type="operation"
     when="1863-11-29">November 29th</date>, the missile was extracted from the popliteal space;
    suppuration continued free and of good character. Two weeks subsequent to the extraction of the
    ball a bit of woolen cloth came from the lower wound. December 10th, patient was allowed to get
    up and move about, using crutches. December 25th, knee joint became painful and continued to
    swell from this date. Under iodine the swelling subsided to a considerable extent, but the pain
    continued; suppuration still free and at times thin and poor in character. On February 1, 1864,
    synovial fluid was observed from the upper point in the discharge; pain in knee joint still
    considerable at night, and leg enlarged. On <date type="operation" when="1864-02-19">February
     19th</date>, the thigh was amputated above the condyles by flap operation; four arteries tied;
    loss of blood small; patient in fair condition constitutionally. On opening the knee joint after
    the operation, erosion of the cartilages was discovered, and an abscess below the knee joint
    communicating with it. February 22d, patient doing well.&#34; The specimen represented in the
    adjacent cut (<hi rend="initialcap">F</hi>IG. 13) was contributed by <name type="person"
     key="123">Surgeon Bliss</name>, and consists of the bones of the knee of the amputated limb,
    showing a slight deposit of callus on the posterior aspect of the shaft, apparently due to the
    irritation set up by contact with the ball in position. The patient was discharged from service
     <date type="servicedischarge" when="1864-04-18">April 18, 1864</date>, and pensioned, and
    subsequently furnished with an artificial limb. In his application for commutation, dated <date
     type="pension" when="1870">1870</date>, he described the stump as being in a sound condition.
    The pensioner was paid <date type="pension" when="1876-06-04">June 4, 1876</date>. In the cut
    only a portion of the specimen, which consists of the four bones entering into the articulation,
    is represented. The amputation was done at the middle of the femur, and not through the lower
    third as represented in the cut. </p>
