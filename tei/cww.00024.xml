                <p>That the service or labor of the aforesaid persons, was, at the time of their
                    discharge, by the said act of Congress, of the value of forty eight hundred

                <p>That your petitioner has been loyal to the Government of the United States; and

                <p>That she acquired the title to the service aforesaid persons by descent from her

                        Ewell</persName> of <placeName>Prince William County Va.</placeName> in

                <p>
                    <add>She removed from <placeName>Virginia</placeName> in <date when="1851">1851</date> with the aforesaid persons to <placeName>Washington
                            D.C.</placeName> and had them registered according to law in the Clerks

                <p>Your petitioner further represents that her claim to the service or labor of said
                    persons does not originate in or by virtue of any transfer heretofore made by
                    any person <pb xml:id="leaf002r" facs="cww.00024.003.jpg"/> who has in any
                    manner aided or sustained the present rebellion against the United States
                    Government.</p>
                <p>And your petitioner, therefore prays the said Commissioners to investigate and
                    determine the validity of her said claim to the service or labor of said persons
                    herein above mentioned and if the same be found to be valid, that they appraise
                    and apportion the value of said claim in money, and report the same to the
                    Secretary of the Treasury of the United States, in conformity to the provisions
                    of said act of Congress.</p>
