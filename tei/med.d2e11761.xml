     >the 16th</date>. <name type="person" key="290">Acting Assistant Surgeon C. A.
    Leale</name>,&#185; in a special report of the case, furnishes the following particulars: "The
    left knee joint was opened by a conoidal ball, which had entered opposite the head of the fibula
    and was extracted at point of entrance. He was very an&#230;mic and in a generally unfavorable
    condition; extensive suppuration had taken place, the leg had become infiltrated with serum, the
    knee joint was filled with pus, and the muscles of the thigh had been separated by extensive
    abscesses extending as high as the apex of Scarpa's triangle. <date type="operation"
     when="1865-04-17">April 17th</date>, no change in his condition; he was placed under the
    influence of ether, and the thigh amputated by the circular operation, at the middle third, by
     <name type="person" key="123">Surgeon D. W. Bliss</name>, <name type="organization" key="132"
     >U. S. V.</name>; the stump was dressed with water, and the patient placed in bed. April 18th,
    although twelve ligatures had been applied, h&#230;morrhage continued to take place (he being
    apparently of a h&#230;morrhagic diathesis), and altogether about eight ounces of blood was
    lost. Applied liquor ferri persulphas by a camel's hair brush to the whole of the surface of the
    wound, which had been left open and exposed to the air for about fifteen minutes; this, with the
    styptic, entirely checked all oozing. April 20th, the granulations had become healthy; about two
    drachms of pus discharged daily. On the 30th the stump had nearly closed. <date type="operation"
     when="1865-06-23">June 23d</date>, a piece of necrosed femur of a conical shape, and about four
    inches in length, was removed. <date type="servicedischarge" when="1865-08-08">August
    8th</date>, he was mustered out of service; his stump (<hi rend="initialcap">F</hi>IG. 192) was
    solid and in good condition." The pensioner was paid <date type="pension" when="1879-06-04">June
