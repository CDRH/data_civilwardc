      Cooper</name>, <name type="organization" key="376">Co. C, 4th Pennsylvania Reserves</name>,
     aged 18 years, was wounded near <name type="place">White Sulphur Springs</name>, <date type="injury" when="1864-06-22"
      >June 22, 1864</date>. He was admitted to the Post Hospital at <name type="place">Beverly</name>, and, on <date type="transfer" when="1864-08-08">August 8th</date>, transferred to the <name type="hospital"
      key="xx">Grafton Hospital</name>. <name type="person" key="xx">Surgeon S. N. Sherman</name>
     reported: &#34;Gunshot wound of left thigh; ball entered two inches above knee, on outer side, exit
     near tuberosity of the ischium; also flesh wound of middle of leg. <date type="operation" when="1864-12-31">December 31st</date>, leg flexed at
     nearly right angle to the thigh, caused principally by contraction of the semimembranosus and
     semitendinosus; motion of knee joint perfect; considerable talipes varus, though without anchylosis. Subcutaneous division of the hamstring
     tendons performed by <name type="person" key="xx">Surgeon S. N. Sherman</name>, <name
      type="organization" key="132">U. S. V.</name>; chloroform used. Patient reacted promptly,
     being in good health, though of rather delicate constitution. After division of the tendons the
     leg was forcibly extended and secured to a straight splint, extending from nates to heel.
     Twenty-four hours after operation patient rested quite easy and entirely free from pain.&#34; The
     patient was furloughed on <date type="furlough" when="1865-04-11">April 11, 1865</date>, and
     admitted to the <name type="hospital" key="172">Emory Hospital</name>, Washington, several
     weeks afterwards. On <date type="servicedischarge" when="1865-06-23">June 23, 1865</date>, he was
     discharged by reason of &#34;paralysis and deformity of the left leg caused by the wound,&#34; and
     pensioned. The man subsequently removed to <name type="place">Birmingham, England</name>, where, in <date type="pension" when="1870-12">December, 1870</date>, he
     was seen by <name type="person" key="xx">Mr. J. B. Gould</name>, the <name type="organization"
      key="xx">U. S. Consul</name>, who described his condition as follows: &#34;His left leg and foot
     are withered, the foot icy cold and curled up like a bird's claw, and the leg withered and dead to the hip joint,&#34; etc. About this time the pensioner was also examined by
     <name type="person" key="xx">Surgeon Jos. Morris</name>, <name type="organization" key="xx">M. R. C. S.</name>, who certified: &#34;I find him suffering from the effects of a gunshot wound of
     the left thigh. The sciatic nerve has been injured, and the entire limb rendered permanently
     and entirely useless. He suffers great pain in the injured limb,&#34; etc. This certificate was
     corroborated by <name type="person" key="xx">Surgeon Jordan</name>, <name type="organization"
      key="xx">F. R. C. S.</name>, and Professor of Surgery at <name type="organization" key="xx">Queen's College</name>, at a subsequent examination on <date type="pension" when="1871-03-04">March 4, 1871</date>. <name type="person"
      key="xx">Surgeon Oliver Pemberton</name>, <name type="organization" key="xx">F. R. C. S.</name>, in charge of the General Hospital at
     <name type="place">Birmingham</name>, certified, on <date type="pension" when="1876-06-06">June 6, 1876</date>: &#34;On <date type="operation" when="1876-05-03">the third day of May, 1876</date>, I amputated the left
     leg of <name type="person" key="928">Thomas Cooper</name> above the knee, the said limb having
     become useless on account of a gunshot wound,&#34; etc. The pensioner was paid <date type="pension" when="1876-06-04">June 4, 1876</date>. </p>
