                    key="214">Fairfax Seminary Hospital</name>. There was no cerebral disturbance at
                the time of his admission. The pericranium was not removed, and it was hoped that
                the skull had escaped uninjured. He was allowed to be up and about the wards, and no
                symptoms of any grave injury appeared until <date type="operation" when="1863-12-13"
                    >December 13th, 1863</date>, when he was suddenly seized, while seated at the
                supper table, with convulsions, and became immediately unconscious. He was taken to
                his bed, and <name type="person" key="411">Surgeon D. P. Smith</name>, <name
                    type="organization" key="132">U. S. V.</name>, laid bare the calvarium at the
                seat of injury, and applied the trephine. Pus was found immediately beneath the bone
                and oozed from the diploe. It was thought expedient to make five perforations with
                the trephine, in order to remove the diseased bone, and to give free exit to pus.
                Convulsions did not recur, but the comatose condition continued, and the case
                terminated fatally <date type="death" when="1863-12-14">twelve hours after the
                    operation</date>. The autopsy revealed diffuse inflammation of the arachnoid and
                of the dura mater. The dura mater was not incised, as it did not bulge into the
                perforations made by the trephine. The pus proceeded altogether from the diploe and
                from between the dura mater and the skull. The specimen was contributed by <name
