     years, was wounded in the left ankle, before <name type="BATTLE" key="7">Petersburg</name>, <date type="injury" when="1864-06-23">June 23, 1864</date>, by a musket ball, which
     contused the external malleolus. He was admitted to <name type="hospital" key="175">Stanton Hospital</name>, Washington, <date type="admit" when="1864-07-04">eleven days after the injury</date>, with the limb greatly swollen and intensely painful.
     An abscess was opened on <date type="operation" when="1864-07-10">July 10th</date>, and three weeks later a thin narrow piece of bone, about
     one inch long, exfoliated from the external malleolus. Subsequently another small necrosed
     piece was removed, after which rapid and steady improvement began and the pain disappeared.
     About September 25th the patient began to walk on crutches.&#185; He was mustered out of service <date
      type="servicedischarge" when="1864-10-13">October 13, 1864</date>, and pensioned. The <name

     leg. In walking he cannot bring the heel to the ground, but puts his weight on the front part
     of the foot." He was paid his pension in <date type="pension" when="1881-06-04">June, 1881</date>. </p>
