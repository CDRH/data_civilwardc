      Haggerty</name>, <name type="organization" key="383">Co. I, 124th New York</name>, aged 21
     years, was wounded at <name type="BATTLE" key="257">Chancellorsville</name>, <date type="injury" when="1863-05-03">May 3, 1863</date>. <name type="person" key="xx">Surgeon J. S.
       Jamison</name>, <name type="organization" key="329">86th New York</name>, noted a "shot wound
     of the right thigh." The patient passed from a Third Corps hospital to <name type="hospital" key="214">Fairfax Seminary</name>, and thence to <name type="hospital" key="xx">Satterlee Hospital</name>, when
     <name type="person" key="xx">Acting Assistant Surgeon I. Roberts</name> reported the case as
     interesting, inasmuch as the ball struck a silver coin in the right pocket of the man's
     trousers and was thus deflected from the track of the femoral vessels; but passed through the
     soft parts, driving fragments of the pocket-book into the tissues, and escaping at the gluteal
     fold. The wound progressed favorably for a time, but, about <date type="injury" when="1863-07-20">July 20th</date>, deep abscesses formed,
     and there was some sloughing at the aperture of entrance and exit. The abscesses were incised,
     and several fragments of the pocket-book came away with the pus. There was so much
     constitutional irritation that quinia and stimulants were freely exhibited. The wound healed
     about the <date type="duty" when="1863-12">middle of December</date>, and the man was transferred to the <name type="organization" key="109">Veteran Reserves</name>. He was quite lame, and the right foot was much everted. He
     was discharged <date type="servicedischarge" when="1864-10-07">October 7, 1864</date>, and pensioned.
     <name type="person" key="874">Examiner J. Nichols</name>, of <name type="place" key="#Washington">Washington</name>, certified: "Ball
     entered anterior aspect of upper third of right thigh, passing directly through, and inflicting
     a frightful flesh-wound. Bone uninjured; cicatrix very deep and adherent to all the soft parts
     below, nearly to the bone, rendering free motion of the limb impossible, and, if much used, very painful." <name type="person" key="xx">Examiner J. Gordon</name>, of <name type="place">Newburgh, New York</name>, reported, <date type="pension" when="1876-02-28">February 28, 1876</date>:  *  *  "There remains a large umbilicated
     cavity, with adhesions of skin, fascia, and muscles. He suffers more particularly from distress
     in the leg, extending in part to the foot, accompanied, before atmospheric changes, with
     shooting, darting pains,  *  *  so severe at times as to unfit him for manual labor." This
     pensioner was paid <date type="pension" when="1876-06-04">June 4, 1876</date>.</p>
