                <!-- A bill of sale is included with this transcription and is affixed to the verso of the first leaf in such a way that it must be lifted in order to read the remainder of the petition. This placement of the bill of sale could suggest that it, the bill of sale, should come second in the reading order. However, I've encoded the remainder of the petion first, and have moved the transcripiton of the bill of sale to the end of the petition proper but before the oath for the verification of the petition. Since the bill of sale is an attachment to the petition, it makes sense to me to present the petition in its entirety followed by the attached materials, which provide proof of ownership and shouldn't necessarily disrupt the reading order of the petition proper. Perhaps a case could be made that the transcription of the bill of sale would be better placed between the recto and verso of the first leaf, since as one flips through the petition, the bill of sale technically comes before the second leaf of the petition. However, I am inclined to maintain the structure of the petition and include the bill of sale after the petition closes. So, I've reflected this inclination in the encoding that follows. Please double-check. Janel, 9/19/11  -->
