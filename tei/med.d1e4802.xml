                                                >October 2</date> as a case of remittent fever. On
                                        the evening of admission the patient's pulse was not
                                        accelerated, but his face was flushed, eyes injected and
                                        skin hot; his tongue was moist and coated white, appetite
                                        deficient, bowels tender and moved once during the day.
                                        Blue-pill and opium were given. Next morning the tongue was
                                        coated yellow and bowels moved; pulse 80, strong; skin
                                        perspiring. Quinine was ordered to be taken at the rate of
                                        sixteen grains a day, with Dover's powder in the evening.
                                        This condition of slight fever with yellow-coated tongue,
                                        anorexia and some headache continued for several days but in
                                        the meantime the bowels became quite loose, meteorized and
                                        tender, especially in the right iliac region. On the 8th the
                                        tongue was red at the tip and edges and yellowish-white in
                                        the centre, the appetite improved and the pulse lowered to
                                        60. Tincture of iron was ordered. During the following week
                                        the bowels were less affected, only one or two stools being
                                        passed daily; the skin was of the natural temperature and
                                        sometimes perspiring, the appetite good, but a slight
                                        headache persisted. A chill occurred suddenly on the 16th,
                                        and next day the pulse was 100, full and strong, the skin
                                        hot and dry, the tongue slightly moist, white at the sides,
                                        yellow in the centre, the appetite poor, the bowels moved
                                        once, the abdomen tender, especially in the right iliac
                                        region. Blue-pill and opium were given in repeated doses. On
                                        the 18th the pulse fell to 70 and several rose-colored spots
                                        appeared on the skin; but the tongue continued coated until
                                        the 28th, Fowler's solution having been given in the
                                        meantime, and the headache, relaxed bowels and abdominal
                                        tenderness lasted for ten days longer. The patient was
                                        transferred, <date type="transfer" when="1861-11-18"
