                                        with diarrh&#339;a, which became worse and was
                                        accompanied by pain in the head, back and abdomen. He was
                                        admitted on <date type="admit" when="1861-08-22">the 22d</date> as a case of gastro-enteritis. Next day
                                        his tongue was heavily coated in the centre but bright-red
                                        at the sides, teeth black with sordes, pulse 100, quick,
                                        bowels tympanitic but not tender, yielding frequent watery
                                        stools. In the evening the fever increased and the patient
                                        was at times delirious. On the 24th the eruption appeared on
                                        the face and abdomen; the tongue became dry and brown; the
                                        stools continued frequent. He was restless at night, and
                                        next day the tongue was fissured, abdomen prominent and mind
                                        disturbed. The eyes were fixed, the expression vacant on the
                                        20th and the patient raved about Mount Vernon on the 27th,
                                        but became rational again on the 28th. On <date type="injury" when="1861-09-01">September 1</date> an
                                        erysipelatous blush appeared on the nose and extended over
                                        the cheek. Tincture of iron was given every three hours and
                                        the face painted with tincture of iodine. The swelling
                                        increased and by the 6th affected the hairy scalp; at this
                                        time there was some cerebral excitement. Wine and
                                        nourishment were given and the iodine reapplied. He was
                                        improved on the 13th and able to sit up on the 15th.
                                        Bed-sores were present on the right hip and on the sacrum.
