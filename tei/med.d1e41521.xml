[This man appears on the hospital register of his regiment, sent to general hospital <date type="transfer" when="1863-06-16">June 16, 1863</date>—fever and blistered feet.]  The symptoms yielded readily to treatment. The patient improved in health, was able to eat his full ration, and was confined to bed but a portion of the time.  June 27th: He complained of pain in the chest, accompanied by some dyspnœa; pulse not much accelerated. A blister was applied, and a combination of expectorants and anodynes directed.  During the night, he grew worse; his respiration became very laborious; he sank rapidly, and died <date type="death" when="1863-06-28">June 28th</date>, at 7 A. M.  <hi rend="italic">Autopsy</hi> <date type="autopsy" when="1863-06-29">twenty-four hours after death</date>: Almost the whole of both lungs was congested. Nothing else abnormal was observed.</p> 
   <p>⃰ It is to be regretted that, in most instances, the records of this hospital do not show by whom the autopsies were made. It is known that many of them were made by <name type="person" key="134">Surgeon Bentley</name> himself, or under his immediate supervision, but it is only possible to distinguish these from the others in a few cases.</p>
