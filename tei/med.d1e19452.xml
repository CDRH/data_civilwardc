          type="organization">Co. F, 8th New York Heavy Artillery</name>, aged 39 years, was wounded
        at <name type="BATTLE" key="263">Cold Harbor</name>, <date type="injury" when="1864-06-03"
          >June 3d, 1864</date>, by a conoidal ball, which entered the left supra-clavicular space,
        and emerged one inch to the left of the middle dorsal vertebr&#230;. He was treated in the
        field until <date type="admit" when="1864-06-11">June 11th</date>, and was transferred to
          <name type="hospital" key="176">Lincoln Hospital</name>, Washington. When admitted, his
        condition was one of very great prostration; suppuration profuse and sanious. Simple
        dressings were applied to the wound. Death took place on<date type="death" when="1864-06-21"
          >June 21st, 1864</date>, from exhaustion. At the necropsy, the ball was found to have
        entered the left supra-clavicular space, passed downward through the thoracic cavity, and
        emerged in the middle of the dorsal region, one inch to the left of the eighth vertebra,
        having fractured the clavicle one and a half inches from its articulation with the acromion
        process, also the first, second, third, fourth, fifth, and sixth ribs, close to their
        attachment to the spine and grooved the posterior surface of the lung, left upper portion.
        On opening the body the veins were found turgid with exceedingly thin blood, which flowed
        out in large quantity. The right lung was attached to the wall by recent adhesions, and the
        left lung by older adhesions. The left cavity contained about two quarts of bloody serous
        fluid. The upper lobe of the right lung presented two large bull&#230;, filled with thin
        blood. There was a wound three and a half inches long in the posterior portion of the upper
        lobe of the left lung. The base of the lower left lobe was carnified. The fractured clavicle
        and injured ribs were contributed to <name type="hospital" key="431">the Museum</name>, with
        the foregoing memoranda, by <name type="person" key="246">Acting Assistant Surgeon H. M.
          Dean</name>. The clavicle is No. 3460 in the Surgical Section. The ribs are represented in
        the accompanying wood-cut (<hi rend="initialcap">F</hi>IG. 236). </p>
