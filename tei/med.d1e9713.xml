                        Virginia</name>, <date type="injury" when="1864-08-25">August 25th, 1864</date>, was
                    struck upon the left side of the head by a fragment of shell which fractured the
                    outer table of the parietal bone, and the zygomatic process of the temporal,
                    denuding the skull over an equilateral triangular surface of four inches a side.  For a few days he was treated in the hospital of the Second Corps, then
                    transferred to <name type="place" key="#Washington">Washington</name>, and on <date type="transfer" when="1864-08-29">the 29th</date> admitted into the <name type="hospital" key="172">Emory

                    was transferred to the <name type="hospital" key="156">Seminary Hospital</name>

                    of a fullness of the head and of imperfect vision of the left eye though there
                    was no perceptible difference in the organs of vision. He was naturally <choice><orig>short sighted</orig><reg>near-sighted</reg></choice>. The general condition of the patient, however, was good.  The case is
