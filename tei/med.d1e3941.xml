                                        Diagnosis&#8212;typhoid fever. On the 12th, after
                                        undergoing much fatigue, he was taken with headache,
                                        weakness and slight diarrh&#339;a. He slept well after
                                        admission, and on the morning of the 20th his countenance
                                        was natural, pulse 88 and strong, skin perspiring, tongue
                                        moist, pale-red at the tip and edges and brownish in the
                                        centre; he had some appetite, slight thirst, two thin watery
                                        stools, some right iliac tenderness, borborygmus and slight
                                        tympanites. Quinine administered in a full dose at noon was
                                        vomited along with much phlegm and greenish-watery liquid.
                                        On the evening of the 21st he again vomited a greenish mass
                                        mixed with the rejected ingesta; he had dizziness and
                                        tinnitus aurium. The tongue on the 23d was covered with
                                        white scales; on the following day it was raw, red in the
                                        centre, pale and slightly coated at the sides; it became
                                        scaly again on the 25th, and the pulse close to 91. On the
                                        26th the pulse was 120 and feeble, the patient delirious,
                                        his countenance haggard and anxious, skin warm, moist and at
                                        times sweating profusely, tongue moist and cleaning from the
                                        tip and edges; he had no pain, but there was much
                                        tympanites, which was relieved by an enema; r&#226;les and
                                        creaking sounds were heard in the upper part of the chest,
                                        and the respirations were increased to 25. The pulse fell to
                                        96 on the 27th, and on the 28th the patient appeared
                                        somewhat better; his mouth and fauces were covered with
                                        aphth&#230;. He had a chill on the afternoon of the
                                        29th, and on the 30th was very nervous, although the tongue
                                        was cleaning, appetite good, bowels quiet and respiration
                                        normal. His condition did not improve materially until
                                        <date when="1861-11-08">November 8</date>, the tongue being occasionally dry and brown or
                                        moist and cleaning, the skin husky and the pulse
                                        accelerated. After that date, however, he slept well, had a
                                        good appetite, no thirst, soft skin and quiet bowels; some
                                        tenderness remained in the right iliac region; he had sore
                                        throat, but no cough, and his respiration was normal. He was
                                        transferred to <name type="place">Annapolis. Md.</name>, on <date type="transfer"
