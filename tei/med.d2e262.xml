      Pierce</name>, <name type="organization" key="101">Co. B, 1st Michigan</name>, aged 22 years,
     was wounded at <name type="BATTLE" key="253">Bull Run</name>, <date type="injury"

     reported: &#34;The patient was admitted to <name type="hospital" key="175">Stanton Hospital</name>
     from <name type="hospital" key="71">Ryland Chapel</name>, <date type="transfer" when="1862-12-05"
      >December 5th</date>, with wound in the right leg. The bullet entered the outer part of the
     front of the middle third of said leg, about midway between the tibia and fibula. The bullet
     did not go through the limb. It, however, went in so deep that it could not be reached by
     exploration. The wound has been healed since the middle of October. The missile has gravitated
     through between the tibia and fibula, and can now be felt deeply seated in the muscles of the
     calf. It gives him no trouble. The anterior tibial nerve was divided by the bullet, in
     consequence of which the muscles of the front of the leg are paralyzed. The end of the foot
     points downward from activity of those on the back of the leg, and the case resembles talipes
     equinus. The patient walks haltingly, but without a cane, by the aid of a high-heeled shoe. He
     has suffered but little pain since the wound healed, and considers himself to be slowly
     improving. He was discharged <date type="servicedischarge" when="1862-12-16">December 16,
      1862</date>.&#34; <name type="person" key="xx">Examiner D. Hudson</name>, of <name
       type="place" key="xx">Lansing, Michigan</name>, reported, <date type="pension" when="1863-05-08">May 8, 1863</date>: &#34;Ball passed
     through both peroneal muscles, dividing the tibial nerve &#42; &#42; and lodging deep in the soleus
     muscle. Ankle joint became stiff at an obtuse angle, requiring a heel more than an inch higher
     on the right shoe than on the left one. Neuralgic pain in foot and ankle daily and hourly.&#34;

     certified, <date type="pension" when="1870-12-07">December 7, 1870</date>: &#34;The ball passed down, and now lies under the skin above the inner
     malleolus. He cannot stand on his leg but a short time, and is getting worse,&#34; etc. They also
     stated that they <date type="operation" when="1870-12-07">excised the bal</date>l, and reported, <date type="pension" when="1872-09">September, 1872</date>: &#34;The nerve is diseased, and
     he suffers great pain through the whole leg; is emaciated and feeble, and growing worse.&#34; This
     pensioner died of &#34;consumption,&#34; <date type="death" when="1872-11-22">November 22, 1872</date>,
     superinduced, in the opinion of the attending physicians, by &#34;the continually depressing
     effects of the pain and tenderness of his limb.&#34; </p>
