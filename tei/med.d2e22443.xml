     years, was wounded in the right ankle during the engagement near <name type="BATTLE" key="26">Bristoe Station</name>, <date type="injury" when="1863-10-13">October 13, 1863</date>, and
     entered <name type="hospital" key="428">Judiciary Square Hospital</name>, Washington, <date type="admit" when="1863-10-16">three days afterwards</date>.  <name type="person" key="905">Assistant Surgeon A. Ingram</name>, <name
      type="organization" key="190">U. S. A.</name>, made the following report:  "The wound was
     caused by a mini&#233; ball, which entered at the internal malleolus, passed into the ankle joint
     and lodged. The missile was extracted <date type="operation" when="1863-10-14">the next day</date> through the wound of entrance. Partial
     excision of the ankle joint was performed on <date type="operation" when="1864-02-01">February 1, 1864</date>, by <name type="person"
      key="958">Acting Assistant Surgeon J. F. Thompson</name>. An incision two and a half inches in size
     was made on the outer side of the ankle and several pieces of bone were taken out. Part of the
     internal malleolus was dissected from the integument and removed through the enlarged wound of
     entrance, and a portion of the <choice><orig>astragalus</orig><reg>talus</reg></choice> was taken away with the bone forceps. At the time of
     the operation the patient's general health was excellent, but considerable inflammation existed
     around the ankle joint and there was great discharge of pus from the wound. A collection of pus had also formed on the outer side at the point of the
     internal incision. The patient did well for about a month after the operation, at which time
     both sides had healed. <date type="operation" when="1864-03">A day or two afterwards</date> an abscess was detected in front of the joint,
     which, on being opened, discharged considerable pus. Carious bone could be felt by the probe,
     indicating the necessity of another operation."  The patient was subsequently transferred to
     <name type="place">Philadelphia</name>, where he was admitted to <name type="hospital" key="xx">Summit House</name> and
     afterwards to <name type="hospital" key="xx">Satterlee Hospital</name>. On <date
      type="servicedischarge" when="1865-05-06">May 6, 1865</date>, he was discharged from service and
     pensioned.  <name type="person" key="xx">Examining Surgeon C. M. Turner</name>, of <name
      type="place" key="xx">Towanda, Pennsylvania</name>, <date type="pension" when="1865-12-27">December 27, 1865</date>, certified to the
     injury and added: "Of course anchylosis has taken place and the tendons of the foot and toes
     are in a degree contracted and rigid." On <date type="pension" when="1869-08-16">August 16, 1869</date>, he reported that the pensioner
     "walks with difficulty and has much pain after exercise. The joint is often inflamed, and
     abscesses form in the integuments, which discharge pus for many days. I do not think the joint
     is carious," etc. At subsequent dates the same examiner certified to the heel bone being diminished in size, and to
     the leg being atrophied up to the knee and shortened two inches. <name type="person" key="xx">Examiner C. F. Paine</name>, of <name type="place" key="xx">Troy, Pennsylvania</name>,
      <date type="pension" when="1879-09-22">September 22, 1879</date>, reported "fistulous openings, constantly discharging portions of bone. The pensioner is compelled to use a crutch
     or cane for locomotion."  The pensioner was paid <date type="pension" when="1880-06-04">June 4, 1880</date>.</p>
