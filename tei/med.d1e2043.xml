                                        age 24; had suffered from fever and ague in June, 1861; but
                                        since then had done his duty uninterruptedly until <date type="admit" when="1861-09-19">September 19</date>,
                                        when he was admitted as a case of typhoid fever. In the
                                        evening the patient was weak and had headache; the bowels
                                        were quiet, but there was some tenderness in the right iliac
                                        region and intestinal gurgling; face flushed; eyes bright;
                                        breath offensive; pulse 88; skin hot and moist; head cool
                                        and sweating; tongue grayish-yellow in the centre, red and
                                        clean at the edges. Ten grains of calomel and jalap were
                                        given. Next day, with a continuance of the symptoms stated,
                                        the patient became dull and stupid and had muscæ and
                                        tinnitus. On the night of the 21st there was delirium, and
                                        the characteristic eruption appeared on the 22d, on which
                                        day also he had two stools with some tympanites and
                                        tenderness; his tongue was black at the base, reddish-white
                                        in the centre and red at the tip. Turpentine emulsion and
                                        wine were given. Next night he was again delirious, and on
                                        the 23d dull, the skin unaltered save by the fading of the
                                        eruption from the chest and abdomen, the bowels quiet,
                                        slightly tympanitic but free from tenderness, and the tongue
                                        cleaning. Dover's powder was given in small doses, with
                                        stimulants. An enema was administered on the 24th, with two
                                        grains of blue-pill and one of quinine every three hours. By
                                        the 26th the eruption had disappeared, but the patient
                                        continued dull; the skin was moist, the tongue cleaning. The
                                        bowels were moved once on this day and on the 27th, and some
                                        tenderness and tympanites remained; but after this the
                                        tongue became clean, the appetite good and the bowels
                                        natural. The patient was returned to duty <date type="duty" when="1861-10-20">October 20</date>. </p>
