                <p>To the Commissioners appointed under the act of Congress of <date when="1862-04-16">April 16, 1862</date>, entitled, "An act for the release
                    of certain persons held to service or labor in the District of Columbia."</p>
                <p>Your Petitioner, <persName>Mary J. Rice</persName>, of <placeName>Georgetown,
                        D.C.,</placeName> respectfully shows, that she is a person loyal to the
                    United States, who, at the time of the passage of said act of Congress, held a
                    claim to service or labor against a person of African descent named
                        <persName>Jane E. Mahorney</persName>, for her life, and that she, the said
                        <persName>Jane E. Mahorney</persName> was, by said act, discharged from said
                    claim; that at that time she was of the age of about fifty years, tall, black,
                    healthy, active and capable, of about the value of six hundred dollars, which is
                    therefore the value of petitioner's claim and she knows of no mental, moral or
                    physical infirmities or defects that impair the value of petitioner's claim.</p>
                <p>Your Petitioner acquired her said claim, in the first instance, by gift from her
                    grandfather when she was very young, that subsequently after the decease of your
                    petitioner's husband, said <persName>Jane E. Mahorney</persName> was sold, as a
                    part of his estate and was purchased by your Petitioner.</p>

                <pb xml:id="leaf001v" facs="cww.00261.002.jpg"/>

                <p>Your Petitioner hereby declares that she bears true and faithful allegiance to
                    the Government of the United States and that she has not borne arms against the
                    United States in the present rebellion, nor in any way given aid or comfort
                    thereto.</p>
                <p>Your Petitioner further avers that she has not brought said <persName>Jane E.
                        Mahorney</persName> in to the <placeName>District of Columbia</placeName>
                    since the passage of said act of Congress and that at the time of its passage
                    she was held to service or labor in said District under &#38; by virtue of your
                    petitioner's said claim, and that said claim does not originate in or by virtue
                    of any transfer heretofore made by any person who has in any manner aided or
                    sustained the present rebellion against the government of the United States.</p>
                <p>Your Petitioner prays you to investigate and determine the validity of her said
                    claim, to appraise &#38; report the same in pursuance of the Act of Congress
                    aforesaid.</p>
