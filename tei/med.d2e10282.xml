      Judd</name>, <name type="organization" key="329">Co. C, 86th New York</name>, aged 18 years,
     was wounded in the right thigh, before <name type="BATTLE" key="xxx">Petersburg</name>, <date
      type="injury" when="1864-09-11">September 11, 1864</date>. He was admitted to the field hospital of the 3d division, Second Corps, whence <name
      type="person" key="xx">Surgeon J. S. Jameson</name>, <name type="organization" key="329">86th
      New York</name>, described the injury as "a compound fracture of the femur at the middle
     third, caused by a musket ball," and reported that he "amputated the limb at the upper third."
     The patient was subsequently transferred to <name type="place">City Point</name>, and three weeks after the date of the
     operation he was moved to hospital at <name type="place">Alexandria</name>, whence <name type="person" key="134">Surgeon
      E. Bentley</name>, <name type="organization" key="132">U. S. V.</name>, described the
     amputation as an "antero-posterior flap operation." The patient was ultimately transferred to
      <name type="hospital" key="428">Judiciary Square Hospital</name>, Washington, and discharged
     from service <date type="servicedischarge" when="1865-01-13">January 13, 1865</date>, and pensioned.
     Previous to leaving the hospital he was supplied with an artificial limb by the <name
      type="organization" key="450">Jewett Patent Leg Company</name>, of <name type="place" key="#Washington">Washington, D. C.</name> In his
     application for commutation, dated <date type="pension" when="1870">1870</date>, the pensioner represented the stump as being in a
     sound condition, but reported the artificial leg as having been unsatisfactory. <name
      type="person" key="xx">Examiner F. R. Wagner</name>, of <name type="place" key="xx">Addison, N. Y.</name>, <date type="pension" when="1874-04-15">April 15, 1874</date>, certified to "amputation about two inches below the
     trochanter minor, leaving the stump so short that an artificial limb cannot be worn." The
     pensioner was paid <date type="pension" when="1879-06-04">June 4, 1879</date>. The specimen, No. 410, <name type="hospital" key="431">Army
      Medical Museum</name>, consists of the middle third of the shaft of the injured femur. It was contributed by the operator.</p>
