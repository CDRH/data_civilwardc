    Curler</name>, <name type="organization" key="170">Co. G, 5th Michigan</name>, was wounded at
     <name type="BATTLE" key="270">Fair Oaks</name>, <date type="injury" when="1862-05-31">May 31,
     1862</date>, and admitted to Hygeia Hospital, <name type="place" key="xx">Fort Monroe</name>,
     <date type="admit" when="1862-06-04">four days afterwards</date>. <name type="person" key="158">Surgeon R. B. Bontecou</name>, <name type="organization" key="132">U. S. V.</name>, reported:
    "Gunshot wound of femoral artery, the ball entering the anterior and middle portion of the
    right thigh and passing out opposite posteriorly, going close to the inside of the femur. The
    temperature of the limb was good, although the artery at the ankle beat feebly. Hæmorrhage
    from both wounds occurred on <date type="operation" when="1862-06-10">June 10th</date>, and
    returned in a few hours. An unsuccessful attempt to find the artery below the wound was made,
    and I tied the femoral, as I supposed, above the profunda; but pulsation being so strong in the
    artery exposed below the ligature, further search was made and the profunda was found unusually
    high up. This was also tied, and no hæmorrhage returned. The foot, before the operation
    warm, now became cold; but by the aid of external heat its temperature returned on the following
    day. The patient was a fine healthy looking young fellow. He was transferred to <name type="place">New York</name> by steamer on <date type="transfer" when="1862-06-12">June
     12th</date>." <name type="person" key="xx">Surgeon S. W. Gross</name>, <name type="organization" key="132">U. S. V.</name>, contributed the specimen shown in the annexed
    cut (<hi rend="initialcap">F</hi>IG. 18) and reported the result of the case as follows:
    "The patient was admitted to DeCamp Hospital, <name type="place">David's Island, New
     York</name>, <date type="admit" when="1862-06-15">June 15th</date>, and was placed under the
    charge of <name type="person" key="xx">Acting Assistant Surgeon W. K. Cleveland</name>. At the
    time of his admission the ligature had come away but the wound had not united. On <date type="operation" when="1862-06-17">June 17th</date>, profuse hæmorrhage occurred from the
    profunda femoris, around which a ligature was cast. The patient, however, had lost so much blood
    that he succumbed <date type="death" when="1862-06-17">two hours after the
    operation</date>." The specimen (<hi rend="initialcap">F</hi>IG. 18) consists of a small
    section of the femoral and profunda arteries, and shows the femoral blocked up with a clot at
    the seat of the ligature, also the ligature around the profunda, where another clot was formed. </p>
