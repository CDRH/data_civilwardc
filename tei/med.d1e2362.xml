                                        taken sick two weeks before with chills, pains in the head
                                        and bones and great muscular debility.
                                        Diagnosis&#8212;typhoid fever. His pulse on admission
                                        was 118 and soft, face flushed dark-red, countenance
                                        anxious, skin hot and dry, tongue thickly coated gray in the
                                        centre, red at the tip and sides, gums and teeth covered
                                        with sordes; there was some diarrh&#339;a with
                                        tenderness of the abdomen and tympanites; the patient lay
                                        with his eyes and mouth partly open, muttering incoherently
                                        when roused. On the 21st he was dull, stupid and difficult
                                        to arouse; pulse 90 and quick, skin hot and moist, tongue
                                        brownish-gray. He had six stools during the day, accompanied
                                        with gurgling but no tenderness. Turpentine emulsion and
                                        enemata of laudanum were ordered. On the 22d he was
                                        restless; pulse 112, small; skin hot and dry, with here and
                                        there dark-red spots which did not disappear on pressure;
                                        tongue brown and dry in middle, moist and red at edges. The
                                        diarrh&#339;a was checked by the enemata, but there was
                                        some tenderness of the abdomen and intestinal gurgling.
                                        Brandy was given. On the 23d the eruption had disappeared;
                                        two stools were passed; the sordes persisted about the lips,
                                        but the tongue was cleaning from the edges. The sordes
                                        disappeared on the 25th. Next day the tongue was clean;
                                        there was some appetite, and the patient looked and said he felt
                                        well; but he was restless and wanted to go out. He had three
                                        stools; pulse 81. In the evening the pulse rose to 100, the
                                        face was flushed, the skin hot and dry, and there was
                                        borborygmus with right iliac tenderness and one stool. On
                                        the morning of the 28th the pulse was 82; the skin warm and
                                        moist; the tongue moist, red at the tip and slightly coated.
                                        His appetite was good on the 29th. He had four stools on the
                                        30th, but no tenderness; his countenance was natural, his
                                        skin warm and soft, and he was gaining strength. On <date
