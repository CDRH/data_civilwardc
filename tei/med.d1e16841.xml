          1864</date>, by a conoidal ball, which inflicted apparently only a lacerated wound of the
        scalp, over the superior anterior angle of the left parietal bone.&#8432; He was conveyed to
          <name type="place" key="#Washington">Washington</name>, and on <date type="admit"
          when="1864-05-23">the 23d</date>, admitted to the <name type="hospital" key="171">Armory
          Square Hospital</name>. On examination the external table was found to be fissured and
        denuded of periosteum. Up to <date type="injury" when="1864-05-30">May 30th</date> the
        patient did not show any symptoms of compression of the brain, but on that day he had a
        chill. On <date type="operation" when="1864-05-31">the 31st</date>, he was placed under the
        influence of ether. <name type="person">Surgeon D. W. Bliss</name>, <name
          type="organization" key="132">U. S. V.</name>, then applied the trephine over the seat of
        injury, and excised a disk one inch in diameter, including only the outer table and
        diplo&#235;. The inner table of the skull was found to be intact, but friable and easily
        broken. Several pieces of this were removed, as was also a clot which had formed between the
        inner table and the dura mater. Simple dressings were applied and tonics administered, but
        py&#230;mia set in, and death ensued on <date type="death" when="1864-06-08">June 8th,
          1864</date>. The specimen is represented in the wood-cut, and consists of a disk and five
        fragments of bone. The largest fragment is from the inner table, and measures three-fourths
        by one and one-fourth inches. The disk is one inch in diameter, and includes the outer table
        and diplo&#235; only. The specimen and history were contributed by <name type="person"
          >Surgeon D. W. Bliss</name>, <name type="organization" key="132">U. S. V.</name></p>
      <p>&#8432;Another report from the Armory Square Hospital states that the inner table was
        depressed at the anterior superior angle.</p>
