     Brown</name>, <name type="organization" key="xxx">Co. G, 134th New York</name>, aged 16 years,
    was accidentally wounded on <date type="injury" when="1862-08-30">August 30, 1862</date>, and
    entered the <name type="hospital" key="192">Mansion House Hospital</name>, <name type="place"
     >Alexandria</name>, <date type="admit" when="1862-09-05">six days afterwards</date>. <name
     type="person" key="xxx">Assistant Surgeon W. A. Conover</name>, <name type="organization"
     key="132">U. S. V.</name>, contributed the following report of the injury: &#34;The ball
    entered the left leg at the posterior middle third, penetrated the tibialis <choice>
     <orig>posticus</orig>
     <reg>posterioris</reg>
    </choice> muscle, and was extracted at the same opening. At first there was free discharge of
    laudable pus, but suppuration increased rapidly, and by September 26th infiltration of the
    tissues had nearly reached the popliteal space. Under a supporting treatment the patient seemed
    to gain rapidly until <date type="injury" when="1862-11-14">November 14th</date>, when, during
    his sleep, a profuse h&#230;morrhage occurred from the sloughing of the posterior tibial artery
    and a great quantity of blood was lost before it was discovered. His condition not admitting an
    operation, the wound was plugged with styptics and a bandage was applied from the toes to the
    hip. This treatment controlled the h&#230;morrhage for eight days, stimulants being given freely
    in the mean time in order to prepare the system for an operation, if necessary. On <date
     type="operation" when="1862-11-28">November 28th</date> another attack of bleeding was promptly
    controlled by the attendant, and, upon consultation, ligation of the femoral artery at the lower
    third was agreed upon as giving the patient a chance for his life. The operation was performed
    with some difficulty, owing to the abnormal structure of a branch artery which had to be
    carefully avoided. The patient bore the operation very well considering his condition, and, on
    the following day, his extremities were perfectly warm and remained so, showing that circulation
    had been re-established. The discharge, however, continued excessive, and although stimulants
    and tonics were used very freely, the patient sank steadily, and died of py&#230;mia on <date
     type="death" when="1862-12-07">December 7, 1862</date>. The autopsy confirmed the extensive
    disorganization from infiltration of pus, the artery being in an unhealthy condition up to
    within an inch of the ligature. The tying of the artery was a success, the clot having been
    perfectly formed and the circulation re-established by the profunda, which was sufficiently
    enlarged for the purpose.&#34; The ligated artery was contributed by <name type="person"
