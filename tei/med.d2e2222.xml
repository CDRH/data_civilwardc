      Brittin</name>, <name type="organization" key="344">Co. M, 1st Pennsylvania Cavalry</name>,
     aged 35 years, was wounded at <name type="BATTLE" key="266">Hanoverton</name>, <date type="injury" when="1864-05-28">May 28, 1864</date>, and admitted to the field hospital of the 3d division, Fifth Corps, where <name
      type="person" key="xx">Surgeon L. W. Read</name>, <name type="organization" key="132">U. S.
       V.</name>, noted &#34;a shot wound of leg. &#34; From the field hospital the patient passed to
     <name type="place" key="#Washington">Washington</name> and thence to <name type="place">Philadelphia</name>, entering the <name type="hospital" key="xx">Summit
      House</name> <date type="transfer" when="1864-06-28">June 28th</date>, and subsequently the <name
      type="hospital" key="xx">Satterlee Hospital</name>. <name type="person" key="137">Surgeon I.
      I. Hayes</name>, <name type="organization" key="132">U. S. V.</name>, recorded the following
     history:  &#34;The injury was caused by a mini&#233; ball passing transversely and producing a slight
     flesh wound of the upper third of the right leg. The wound healed, when it was attacked by
     gangrene, and after again becoming healthy the whole limb was seized with erysipelas. On March 24, 1865, the whole external lateral surface of the knee presented two
     sloughing wounds, one on a line with the head of the tibia, the other just above the tendon of
     the muscle. The whole limb was swollen, red, and painful. General condition poor, with
     headache, fever, dry tongue, and dry hot skin. On <date type="operation" when="1865-03-26">March 26th</date>, a large collection of pus,
     amounting to about six ounces, was evacuated immediately below the patella. The patient's bed
     was moved, the old splint removed and a Smith's anterior applied. On rinsing the limb a
     sloughing wound involving nearly the whole popliteal space was found. On the following day the
     patient was slightly more comfortable, but there was not much change in his general condition.
     On March 31st, there was no change in the appearance of the wound, but the patient's strength
     was evidently becoming exhausted. There were symptoms of py&#230;mia, and he was delirious
     during the afternoon, but better toward evening. His pulse was 120 and very small; countenance
     sunken, with hectic spots on the cheeks. He complained of no pain, but was evidently partially
     unconscious. He died <date type="death" when="1865-04-06">April 6, 1865</date>. &#34;   </p>
