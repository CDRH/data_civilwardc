                                        diarrh&#339;a followed by fever. On the day after

                                        noticed; the skin continued moist but the tongue was dry,
                                        red and glossy. Emulsion of turpentine was given. Next day
                                        sudamina appeared, and the patient was dull mentally, quite
                                        deaf and at times delirious. Rose-colored spots were very
                                        numerous on the 6th and 7th. The bowels were moved two or
