                <p>To the Commissioners under the act of Congress approved the <date

                    Petitioner to such service or labor:&#8212;</p>
                <p>That your petitioner acquired his claim to the aforesaid service or labor of said

                <p>That your petitioner's claim to the service or labor of said
                        <persName>Ginnie</persName> at the time of said discharge, was of the value
                    of Eight Hundred Dollars in money; She is Faithful, Kind &#38; honest, a good
                    nurse; sometimes sick with rheumatism complaints, but as your petitioner is
                    informed and believes, they do not materially affect her value, they certainly
                    have not heretofore affected her hire.</p>

                <p>Your Petitioner declares that he bears true &#38; faithful allegiance to the
                    Government of the <placeName>United States</placeName> and has never in any way
                    given aid or comfort to its enemies&#8212;And Your Petitioner further states and
                    alleges that at the time of the passage of the said Act of Congress,
                        <persName>Ginnie</persName> was held to service or labor in the
                        <placeName>District of Columbia</placeName> under and by virtue of your
                    Petitioner's claim to such labor or service;&#8212;and that his said claim does
                    not originate in or by virtue of any transfer heretofore made by any person who
                    has in any manner aided or sustained the present rebellion against the
                    Government of the <placeName>United States</placeName>.</p>

                <p>And your petitioner prays the said Commissioners to investigate and determine the
                    validity of his said claim herein set forth, and if valid, that they appraise
                    and apportion the value of said claim in money and report the same to the
                    Secretary of the Treasury in conformity with the provisions of the said act of
