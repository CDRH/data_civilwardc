        <hi rend="initialcap">C</hi>ASE.&#8212;<name type="person">Private Albert Silsbee</name>,
          <name type="organization">Co. D, 86th New York Volunteers</name>, aged 18 years, was
        wounded at <name type="BATTLE" key="292">Beverly Ford, Virginia</name>, <date type="injury"
          when="1863-06-09">June 9th, 1863</date>. While lying on his left side, his head being
        toward the enemy, the missile, probably a buckshot, entered just anteriorly to the tragus of
        the ear, making a wound having an incised appearance, and lodged somewhere near the ramus of
        the jaw. He was admitted, on <date type="admit" when="1863-06-10">the next day</date>, to
          <name type="hospital" key="176">Lincoln Hospital</name>, Washington, where water dressings
        were applied. The ball could not be discovered. There was no wound of the mouth or fauces,
        but considerable swelling of the right cheek, with lividity about the right eye; both eyes
        were slightly injected and felt sore. The patient had no bad symptoms after admission, and,
        as he was not suffering inconvenience from the ball, operative interference was thought
        unjustifiable. He was transferred, on <date type="transfer" when="1863-06-16">June
          16th</date>, to West's Buildings Hospital, <name type="place">Baltimore</name>, whence he
        was returned to duty on <date type="duty" when="1863-06-27">June 27th, 1863</date>. He is
        not a pensioner. The history of this case was reported from <name type="hospital" key="176"
          >Lincoln Hospital</name> by <name type="person">Medical Cadet J. N. Hyde</name>, <name
          type="organization" key="190">U. S. A.</name>, from West's Buildings Hospital by <name
          type="person">Surgeon T. H. Bache</name>, <name type="organization" key="190">U. S.
          A.</name> The concealment of the ball under the petrous bone, perhaps, or in the pterygoid
        fossa, or behind the ramus of the lower jaw, was esteemed very remarkable, and the aspect of
        the entrance wound was unusual. <name type="person" key="288">Surgeon J. H. Brinton</name>,
          <name type="organization" key="132">U. S. V.</name>, therefore, had a careful drawing
        made, in color, of the wound, by <name type="person">Hospital Steward Stauch</name>. This is
        accurately copied in the right-hand or upper figure of the chromo-lithograph. It is
        unlikely, but not impossible, that the missile fell out before the patient's admission to
        hospital. </p>
