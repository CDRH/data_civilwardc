                                        patient was reported as quite weak and without appetite; his
                                        pulse 85 and quick; face flushed; eyes suffused; sense of
                                        hearing somewhat dulled; skin natural, showing an eruption
                                        which was not considered characteristic; tongue brown in the
                                        centre and moist at the edges; bowels quiet. Tincture of
                                        iron was ordered three times daily, turpentine emulsion
                                        every three hours, and Dover's powder at night. He slept
                                        some during the night and perspired towards morning, when
                                        the eruption of the previous day was found to have
                                        disappeared and been replaced by an abundance of
                                        rose-colored spots; there was some borborygmus, but no stool
                                        and no tenderness or tympanites of the abdomen. The patient
                                        was thirsty and his tongue red, dry and slightly furred, but
                                        there was less deafness. In the evening castor oil was
                                        given, after which he slept badly and had five passages from
                                        the bowels during the night with some umbilical pain; he
                                        perspired towards morning. Next day the tongue was red, dry
                                        and glossy, and the eruption fading. On the evening of the 25th acetate of lead and tannin were given with Dover's
                                        powder. On the 26th the pulse was 80, the skin soft and
                                        natural, the eruption disappeared, the tongue yellowish and
                                        slightly furred, the appetite improved and the bowels quiet.
                                        Some rose-spots appeared on the 27th and 28th, disappearing
                                        on the 30th. The bowels remained unmoved from the 26th until
                                        the 30th, when there was one stool; after this they
                                        continued unmoved until October 3, when the record
                                        closes—the patient's skin being in natural
                                        condition, his tongue clean but a little dry in the centre
                                        and his appetite good. He was transferred to <name type="place">Annapolis, Md.</name>,
