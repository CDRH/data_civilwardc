[The following entries with regard to this man appear on the register of the hospital of his regiment: <date type="admit" when="1861-12-25">December 25, 1861</date>&#8212;diarrh&#339;a; <date type="admit" when="1862-06-03">June 3, 1862</date>&#8212;cold; <date type="admit" when="1862-06-17">June 17th</date>&#8212;soreness in chest; <date type="admit" when="1862-06-26">June 26th</date>&#8212;cough, and pain in the chest; <date type="admit" when="1862-06-27">June 27th</date>&#8212;spitting blood; <date type="admit" when="1862-07-31">July 31st</date>&#8212;night sweats; <date type="transfer" when="1862-08-15">August 15th</date>&#8212;sent to general hospital at Fortress Monroe.]  The patient was admitted in a dying condition, having a loose stool every two hours. The discharges were dark, watery, bilious looking, and frequently involuntary. The pulse was scarcely perceptible at the wrist.  Treatment: Stimulants, anodynes and astringents.  Died, <date type="death" when="1862-10-31">October 31st</date>.  <hi rend="italic">Autopsy</hi> <date type="autopsy" when="1862-10-31">eight hours after death</date>: Body extremely emaciated. The lungs were healthy. The pericardium contained four ounces of fluid. The gall-bladder was moderately filled with bile. The spleen was enlarged and softened. The intestines were distended with flatus, highly injected, and the mucous membrane softened. The bladder and kidneys were healthy.</p> 
   <p>&#8432; It is to be regretted that, in most instances, the records of this hospital do not show by whom the autopsies were made. It is known that many of them were made by <name type="person" key="134">Surgeon Bentley</name> himself, or under his immediate supervision, but it is only possible to distinguish these from the others in a few cases.</p>
