                <p>To the Commissioners under the act of Congress approved the <date when="1862-04-16">16th of
                    April 1862</date> entitled "An act for the release of certain persons held to service or
                    labor in the <placeName>District of Columbia</placeName>."</p>
                
                <p>This the Petition of <persName>James E. Morgan</persName> the next friend and Agent of Mrs <persName>Sarah Webster</persName> a married woman, represents and states, that he believes her to be a person loyal to the <placeName>United States</placeName> and that she at the time of the passage of the said act of Congress held a claim to service or labor against the following person of African descent of the name of <persName>Rosetta Ghentt</persName> for and during the life of said <persName>Rosetta Ghentt</persName> and that at the time of the passage of said Act, the said person so held to service was living in said <placeName>District</placeName> where she has lived for many years &#38; she was then about thirty one or two years old and of the personal description following mulatto, stout built, &#38; healthy appearance</p>
                
                <p>The said <persName>Mrs Webster</persName> acquired her claim to the aforesaid service or labor of said <persName>Rosetta Ghentt</persName> by the last will and testament of <persName>Mary A Carroll</persName> which is on record in <placeName>Baltimore County Maryland</placeName> &#38; was <gap reason="illegible" extent="one word" quantity="6" unit="chars"/>

                    <date when="1860-01-31">31st January 1860</date>.</p>
                
                <p>that said claim to the service or labor of said <persName>Rosetta Ghentt</persName> was at the time of said discharge therefrom of the value of one thousand Dollars in money</p>
                
                <p>The said <persName>Morgan</persName> hereby declares that he believes the said <persName>Mrs. Webster</persName> bears true &#38; faithful allegiance to the Government of the <placeName>United States</placeName> &#38; that she has not in any way given aid or comfort to the rebellion and said <persName>Morgan</persName> further states and alleges, that he knows that said <persName>Mrs Webster</persName> has not brought said servant into the <placeName>District of Columbia</placeName> since the passage of said act of Congress; and that, at the time of the passage thereof, said <persName>Rosetta Ghentt</persName> was held to service or labor therein under &#38; by virtue of said <persName>Mrs Webster</persName>s claim to such service or labor. The said <persName>Morgan</persName> states and alleges that said claim to the service or labor of said <persName>Rosetta Ghentt</persName> does not originate in or by virtue of any transfer heretofore made by any person who has in any manner aided or sustained the present rebellion against the Government of the <placeName>United States</placeName>. And said <persName>Morgan</persName> as said next friend prays the said Commissioners to investigate and determine the validity of <persName>Mrs Webster</persName>s claim to the service or labor of said <persName>Rosetta Ghentt</persName> herein above set forth; and if the same be found to be valid, that <pb xml:id="leaf002r" facs="cww.01086.003.jpg"/> they appraise and apportion the value of said claim in money, and report the same to the Secretary of the Treasury of the <placeName>United States</placeName>, in conformity to the provisions of said act of Congress.</p>
