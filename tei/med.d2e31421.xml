After treatment in <name type="hospital" key="71">Ryland Chapel</name>, he was admitted, <date type="transfer" when="1862-12-05">December 5th</date>, to <name type="hospital" key="175">Stanton Hospital</name>.  <name type="person" key="70">Surgeon J. A. Lidell</name>, <name type="organization" key="132">U. S. V.</name>, reported: &#34;The patient received a gunshot wound of the left elbow joint. The forearm was partially bent upon the arm at the time of injury. The bullet entered the outside of the joint close to the ulna, and passed directly inward, splitting the ulna, passing through the articulation, and escaping on the inner side of the joint; thence continuing its course inward and grazing the antero-lateral part of his body. For about six weeks after he was hurt the wound at the elbow pained him a great deal, and discharged copiously. The joint has never swelled to a marked degree. No large bone splinters have been discharged. Some bone in the form of grit, as the patient calls it, has been discharged, but the quantity has not been large; he has been treated for the most part with the water dressing. The wound is now nearly closed; discharge trifling.  Anchylosis has occurred; all motion of joint lost, including pronation and supination. There is now no pain, and but little soreness; the forearm is permanently flexed on the arm at an obtuse angle of about 120&#176;. He has good motion of the fingers, hand, and wrist; the amount of atrophy is small. Discharged from the service on surgeon's certificate of disability. <date type="servicedischarge" when="1863-01-13">January 13, 1863</date>, condition improving; excellent prospect of preserving a useful limb.&#34;  <name type="person" key="xxx">Examiner P. R. Palm</name>, of <name type="place">Allentown, Pennsylvania</name>, <date type="pension" when="1872-05-04">May 4, 1872</date>, certifies: &#34;The joint is completely anchylosed, and the arm partly bent and considerably atrophied. Complains of want of strength in the limb, and cannot well grasp objects; says he has much pain in the whole arm.&#34; And <date type="pension" when="1874-05-06">May 6, 1874</date>: &#34;There is anchylosis of the joints of the left hand, partly.&#34;  This pensioner was paid <date type="pension" when="1874-12-04">December 4, 1874</date>.</p>
