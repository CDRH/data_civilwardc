    near the spine. <date type="admit" when="1864-05">Several days after receiving the injury</date>
    the wounded man was admitted to <name type="hospital" key="173">Harewood Hospital</name>,
    Washington, where he did well up to May 23d. From that date his mind became wandering and
    delirious, his left arm and right leg keeping up constant motion. Irritation from the wound was
    suspected as the cause of this unusual action, and amputation was deemed necessary on <date type="operation" when="1864-05-25">May 25th</date>. when <name type="person" key="158">Surgeon
     R. B. Bontecou</name>, <name type="organization" key="132">U. S. V.</name>, performed the
    operation by his modification of Pirogoff's method at the ankle joint. The patient improved
    after the amputation, all symptoms of derangement of mind disappeared, and he became perfectly
    conscious. Ether was used as the anæsthetic. The patient continued to do well up to June
    1st, when pyæmic symptoms appeared, the wound ceased to suppurate, and rigors set in; skin
    hot and dry. In spite of a supporting treatment the patient gradually grew weaker. He died <date type="death" when="1864-07-19">July 19, 1864</date>. The tarsal bones, together with the
    malleoli and a thin section of the tibia, removed at the amputation (<hi rend="italic">Spec</hi>. 3054), with the history, were contributed to <name type="hospital" key="431">the
