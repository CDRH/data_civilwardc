                <p>To the Commissioners under the Act of Congress approved the <date when="1862-04-16">16th of April, 1862</date>, entitled "An Act for the
                    release of certain persons held to service or labor in the <placeName>District
                        of Columbia</placeName>:</p>

                <p>Your Petitioner, <persName>Ann M. Washington</persName> of the <placeName>City of
                        Washington, D.C.</placeName>, by this her petition in writing represents and
                    states that she is a person loyal to the <placeName>United States</placeName>,
                    who, at the time of the passage of said Act of Congress, held a claim to service
                    or labor against two persons of African descent named <persName>Eliza
                        Tippins</persName> and <persName>Ludwell Gunnell</persName>, for and during
                    the lives of said persons; and that by said Act of Congress said persons were
                    discharged and freed of and from all claim of your petitioner to such service or
                    labor, as your petitioner is informed and believes, that at the time of said
                    discharge said persons were of the ages and the personal description following: <list>
                        <item>The said <persName>Eliza Tippins</persName>, aged eleven years, of a
                            mulatto color, four feet six inches high.</item>
                        <item>The said <persName>Ludwell Gunnell</persName>, aged twenty-one years,
                            of a dark mulatto color, five feet eight inches high.</item>
                    </list></p>
                <p>That your petitioner acquired her claim to the aforesaid service or labor of said
                    persons in manner following: To <persName>Eliza Tippins</persName> by parol gift
                    from Mrs. <persName>Cornelia Macrae</persName> of <placeName>Fauquier County,
                        Virginia</placeName>, about two years ago; and to <persName>Ludwell
                        Gunnell</persName> by parol gift from <persName>Richard B. Lee</persName>
                    formerly of <placeName>Washington, D. C.</placeName>, about ten years ago.</p>

                <p>That your petitioner's claim to the service <pb xml:id="leaf001v" facs="cww.00952.002.jpg"/> or labor of said persons was, at the time of said
                    discharge therefrom, of the value of two thousand dollars in money. That said
                        <persName>Eliza Tippins</persName> is a waiter and chambermaid, is
                    well-formed, healthy and large for her age; and said <persName>Ludwell
                        Gunnell</persName> is a good dining-room and house servant, likely and
                    strong; and that both said persons are free from any moral, mental or bodily
                    infirmity or defect.</p>

                <p>Your petitioner hereby declares that she bears true and faithful allegiance to
                    the Government of the <placeName>United States</placeName>; and that she has not
                    borne arms against the <placeName>United States</placeName> in the present
                    rebellion, nor in any way given aid or comfort thereto.</p>

                <p>And your petitioner further states and alleges, that she has not brought said
                    persons into the <placeName>District of Columbia</placeName> since the passage
                    of said act of Congress; and that, at the time of the passage thereof, said
                        <persName>Eliza</persName> and as she believes, said
                        <persName>Ludwell</persName> were held to service or labor therein under and
                    by virtue of your petitioner's claim to such service or labor.</p>

                <p>Your petitioner further states and alleges, that her said claim to the service or
                    labor of said persons does not originate in or by virtue of any transfer
                    heretofore made, since the present rebellion against the Government of the
                        <placeName>United States</placeName>, by any person who has in any manner
                    aided or sustained the same.</p>

                <p>And your petitioner prays the said Commissioners to investigate and determine the
                    validity of her said claim to the service or labor of said persons herein above
                    set forth; and if the same be found to be valid, that they appraise and
                    apportion the value of said claim in money and report the same to the Secretary
                    of the Treasury of the <placeName>United States</placeName> in conformity with
                    the provisions of said Act of Congress.</p>
