     Skinner</name>, <name type="organization" key="96">Co. H, 6th Maine</name>, aged 30 years, was
    wounded at <name type="BATTLE" key="10">Chancellorsville</name>, <date type="injury"

     Hospital</name>, Washington, <date type="admit" when="1863-05-08">five days afterwards</date>.
     <name type="person" key="457">Assistant Surgeon C. C. Lee</name>, <name type="organization"
     key="190">U. S. A.</name>, reported: "This man suffered a comminuted fracture of the left leg
    from a musket ball, which entered one-half inch internally to the spine of the tibia, passed
    through antero-posteriorly, and emerged at a corresponding point at the back of the leg. Much
    contusion and ecchymosis existed at the time of his admission to the hospital, and but for the
    high state of inflammatory action then existing the leg would have been removed. The limb was
    then placed in a fracture-box filled with bran, and covered with water dressings; nutrients and
    stimulants were given freely. No change was perceptible until the morning of May 16th, when the
    foot and leg were found in a state of advanced gangrene. To show how rapidly this condition
    supervened it is only necessary to state that a most careful examination during the previous
    evening failed to reveal anything of the kind, the patient in all respects seeming as well as
    usual. By the next morning this condition of the leg was rapidly extending up the thigh, the
    soft tissues of which became boggy and crepitant; the patient being bathed in clammy sweats, and
    his circulation so depressed that the pulse was imperceptible at the wrist, though at the groin
    it was 160 per minute. At the same time the patient's spirits were not at all depressed, and he
    could hardly believe he was in any danger. His prostration was such that amputation was
    deferred; but the most energetic stimulation failed to bring his condition into one of
    sufficient reaction to bear the operation. He gradually sank, and died at 2 o'clock on the
    morning of <date type="death" when="1863-05-17">May 17, 1863</date>. At the autopsy, the
    internal organs were discovered to be generally healthy. The bone was found to be extensively
    comminuted, with a portion of the bullet lying upon the lacerated and obliterated posterior
    tibial vessels, thus probably furnishing the main cause of the gangrene. No secondary abscesses
    were found, and it was concluded that the patient had died in the primary stage of blood
    poisoning." The upper halves of the injured bones, showing a transverse fracture of fibula and
    comminution of the tibia, with the battered bullet attached, were contributed to the <name
