     Carolina</name>, aged 23 years, was wounded in the right leg, at <name type="BATTLE" key="79">Hatcher's Run</name>, <date type="injury" when="1865-03-13">March 13, 1865</date>. He was
    treated in Confederate hospitals until <date type="admit" when="1865-05-06">May 6th</date>, when
    he was admitted into hospital at <name type="place" key="xx">Point Lookout</name>. Subsequently
    he was transferred to <name type="hospital" key="171">Armory Square</name>, and lastly to <name type="hospital" key="162">Douglas Hospital</name>, Washington. <name type="person" key="201">Assistant Surgeon W. F. Norris</name>, <name type="organization" key="190">U. S. A.</name>, in
    charge of the latter, made the following report: "The wound was caused by a ball perforating the
    tibia at the upper third without involving the knee joint. The patient was cachectic and much
    emaciated, the wound indolent and discharging a thin unhealthy pus. Stimulants, tonics, and good
    nutritious diet were freely exhibited. On <date type="operation" when="1865-09-03">September
     3d</date> the wound was carefully examined and a considerable quantity of carious bone was
    removed. On the next day the patient had a severe chill which recurred on the 6th. He had been
    subject to periodical chills and fever, and this attack of intermittent yielded readily to a
    full dose of quinine. On September 10th slight diarrhœa came on and continued for nine
    days, the patient growing much weaker. The wound, which had improved in appearance after the
    removal of the dead bone, again looked unhealthy, small abscesses having formed along the line
    of the tibia, which, when opened and examined by the probe, showed extensive necrosis of the
    bone. Subsequently the patient had a slight chill, which was followed by an attack of erysipelas
    of the leg, and from this period he steadily declined. He died, apparently of exhaustion, on
     <date type="death" when="1865-10-01">October 1, 1865</date>. The autopsy showed a dirty
    yellowish clay color of the skin. The thoracic and abdominal organs were apparently healthy,
    except the liver and the spleen, the former being enlarged and the latter much softened and
    weighing fourteen ounces." The perforated tibia, contributed with the history by <name type="person" key="201">Assistant Surgeon Norris</name>, and constituting <hi rend="italic">Specimen</hi> 1444 of the <hi rend="italic">Surgical Section</hi> of <name type="hospital" key="431">the Museum</name>, exhibits the deposit of a large quantity of callus on the outside
    of the bone, and shows the cavity of the passage of the ball to be enlarged by ulceration, the
    lower portion of the shaft being superficially necrosed. Posterior and lateral views of the
    specimen are copied in the wood-cuts (<hi rend="initialcap">F</hi>IGS. 405, 406).</p>
