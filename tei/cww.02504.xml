            </opener>
            
            <p>The draft in the District is <lb/>nearly completed, and whilst it has created a <lb/>great deal of excitement, it has not been void <lb/>of many amusing incidents, particularly in the <lb/>First Ward, which is generally called the <lb/>Court-end, or Upper-tendom, much to the <choice><orig>de-<lb/>light</orig><reg>delight</reg></choice> of the low and vicious. The draft has <lb/>fallen on many of our useful young men <choice><orig>en-<lb/>gaged</orig><reg>engaged</reg></choice> in pursuits of civil life. There are <lb/>many young men about Washington engaged <lb/>in doing nothing, who could be better spared, <lb/>and not missed from this community, than <lb/>those young men who have been drafted and <lb/>are so useful in society.</p>
            
            <p>This draft is singular in its operations; it <lb/>seems to baffle the understanding of many. <lb/>But one thing is certain: the drafted men <lb/>seem to learn very quick how to look for a <choice><orig>sub-<lb/>stitute</orig><reg>substitute</reg></choice>. They learn that sooner than anything <lb/>else. But substitutes seem to be scarce, and <lb/>some of the drafted, or lucky, ones are at their <lb/>wits' ends to find a substitute, but it is just <lb/>as I predicted. I have urged them to enlist, <lb/>and not wait for the draft. They have put me <lb/>off by asking the silly question, "What are we <lb/>going to fight for?"  Now they are drafted, <lb/>that question they have lost sight of.</p>
            
            <p>Aside from drafting, Washington is dull. I <lb/>stroll about to gather up something for your <lb/>most excellent paper, and the other evening I <lb/>dropped in at the 15th Street Presbyterian <lb/>church, where a meeting of the Contraband <lb/>Relief Association was being held. There I <lb/>had the extreme pleasure of seeing the flag <lb/><choice><sic>gotton</sic><corr>gotten</corr></choice> up by this Association for the First <lb/>Colored District regiment. It is a beautiful <lb/>one, and seems to get the admiration of <choice><orig>every-<lb/>body</orig><reg>everybody</reg></choice> that has seen it. The design is most <choice><orig>ex-<lb/>cellent</orig><reg>excellent</reg></choice>, and the artist, Mr. Bowser, of <choice><orig>Philadel-<lb/>phia</orig><reg>Philadelphia</reg></choice>, has a multitude of plaudits bestowed <lb/>upon him for his great artistic powers. I <choice><orig>hap-<lb/>pened</orig><reg>happened</reg></choice> in the meeting just as the President <lb/>(Mrs. Keckley) called the house to order. The <lb/>house was crowded. Here let me say that the <lb/>President presided with dignity, modesty and <lb/>firmness. The whole Society seemed to be <lb/>present, and she managed them with ease and <lb/>comfort, and all seemed to reverence her <choice><orig>posi-<lb/>tion</orig><reg>position</reg></choice>. In a word, she is a noble woman.</p>
            
            <p>Speaking of societies, I cannot let this <choice><orig>occa-<lb/>sion</orig><reg>occasion</reg></choice> pass without noticing the Colombian <choice><orig>Har-<lb/>mony</orig><reg>Harmony</reg></choice> Cemetery Association. Of all societies <lb/>that I have had the pleasure of visiting, this <lb/>is the most dignified. Were you present at <lb/>one of their sessions, you would think you <lb/>were in the midst of grave senators. The <choice><orig>As-<lb/>sociation</orig><reg>Association</reg></choice> has a cemetery about two and a half <lb/>miles from the city. A visit out there last <lb/>week perfectly convinced me that it was <emph rend="italic">the <lb/>cemetery</emph>; in fact there is no burial-ground of <lb/>any note (of color) in the vicinity of <choice><orig>Washing-<lb/>ton</orig><reg>Washington</reg></choice> except this. It is beautiful beyond <choice><orig>de-<lb/>scription</orig><reg>description</reg></choice>. Adorned with cedars that would <lb/>compare with the cedars of Lebanon that we <lb/>read of in the Scriptures, it contains about <lb/>seventeen acres of land, all enclosed with a <lb/>good fence, sexton's house, etc. The <choice><orig>Associa-<lb/>tion</orig><reg>Association</reg></choice> contemplates building a chapel, which, <lb/>when done, will add much to the appearance <lb/>of the ground. This is the place where rest <lb/>the remains of the late Dr. Robert Boyd Leach <lb/>of Cleveland, Ohio, who died in Philadelphia <lb/>on the 29th of July. The death of this good <lb/>man will be keenly felt by all who knew him. <lb/>In looking at the different tombstones, I came <lb/>across one towering over the remains of the <lb/>lamented Rev. John F. Cook, who was a <choice><orig>mem-<lb/>ber</orig><reg>member</reg></choice> of this Association; also, of the late <choice><orig>An-<lb/>drew</orig><reg>Andrew</reg></choice> Foote, Francis Datcher, and many old <lb/>citizens whom I remember well in their palmiest <lb/>days; but they are all gone to that rest <choice><orig>pre-<lb/>pared</orig><reg>prepared</reg></choice> for the people of God.</p>
