                                                  maxilla, breaking out both upper and lower

                                                  muscles. He was admitted, on <date type="admit" when="1862-08-31">the next day</date>, to the

                                                  exhausted condition. Stimulants and nourishing
                                                  diet were given. The ball could not be found.

                                                  dressings applied. On September 6th, the wound was
                                                  suppurating freely. On <date type="injury" when="1862-09-12">September 12th</date>, secondary
                                                  h&#230;morrhage occurred, probably from the tonsillar

                                                  made one inch in front of the angle of the
                                                  inferior maxilla, at the lower posterior edge of
                                                  the gland, and the bullet extracted. It was found
                                                  to be much flattened and bent, and thickly set

                                                  applied to promote suppuration. On October 26th,
                                                  the wounds in the cheek and fauces were closed,
