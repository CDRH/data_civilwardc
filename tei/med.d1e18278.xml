                wounded at <name type="BATTLE" key="259">the Wilderness</name>, <date type="injury" when="1864-05-05">May 5th, 1864</date>, by a conoidal ball, which entered the
                    right side of the face, midway between the eye and the upper lip, passed
                    downward and outward, emerging on the left side of the face, immediately below
                    the malar bone, producing a compound fracture of the superior maxilla, and
                    destroying the four front teeth, eye tooth, and three large teeth on the left
                    side, with their alveolar processes, and part of the palate process. He
                    received also a wound in the leg. On <date type="admit" when="1865-02-24">February 24th, 1865</date>, he was admitted to <name type="hospital" key="167">Carver Hospital</name>, Washington. The wound
                    was entirely healed when admitted, but the cicatrix produced great deformity of
                    the upper lip, interfering with proper articulation. On <date type="operation" when="1865-03-08">March 8th</date>, <name type="person" key="102">Surgeon O. A. Judson</name>, <name type="organization" key="190">U. S. A.</name>, decided to operate, and having etherized the patient, made an
                    incision from wound of entrance down ward through the upper lip and a large
                    portion of the cicatrix. The adhesions that were found beneath were dissected
                    up, and the parts brought in apposition by pinsutures. Simple dressings were
                    applied to the wound. The case progressed favorably, and, by <date type="operation" when="1865-03-22">March 22d</date>, the
                    wound had nearly healed by first intention. The lip presented a much better
                    appearance, the articulation was greatly improved, and the patient could readily
                    partake of solid food. On <date type="transfer" when="1865-04-08">April 8th</date>, he was transferred to <name type="hospital">Mower Hospital,
                        Philadelphia</name>, whence he was discharged from service on <date type="servicedischarge" when="1865-06-24">June 24th, 1865</date>. On
                <date type="pension" when="1866-01-03">January 3d, 1866</date>, <name type="person">Pension Examiner H. T. Montgomery</name> reports "a large opening
                    from mouth to nose;  great permanent deformity of face; voice and mastication
                    impaired." He rates his disability three-fourths, partly by reason of the wound
                    of the foot. </p>
