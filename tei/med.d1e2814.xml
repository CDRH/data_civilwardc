                                        Diagnosis—typhoid fever. He had been healthy until
                                        <date type="injury" when="1861-10-14">Oct. 14</date>, when he was seized with chills followed by fever
                                        and sweating. On admission he had epistaxis,
                                        diarrhœa, anorexia, thirst and cough. Next day his
                                        eyes were dull and slightly injected; pulse 91 and quick; skin hot and
                                        dry, presenting a profusion of colored spots on the chest
                                        and some on the abdomen; tongue slightly moist, red at the
                                        tip and edges but coated white in the centre; lips black
                                        with sordes; two stools were passed during the twenty-four
                                        hours; there was some meteorism and also a slight cough.
                                        Tincture of iron was prescribed. Next day eight stools were
                                        passed, and there was some cough with expectoration of
                                        tenacious mucus. Turpentine emulsion, lead, tannin and opium
                                        were prescribed. The diarrhœa, which was attended
                                        with much tympanites, became checked in the course of a few
                                        days and the bowels thereafter remained quiet or with not
                                        more than one movement daily; the skin continued hot and dry
                                        throughout. Fresh crops of rose-colored spots appeared on
                                        the 24th, 26th and 30th, and were reported on November 2 as
                                        fading and unelevated; but on the 3d and 5th the chest is
                                        noted as covered with sudamina. Deafness was recorded on
                                        Oct. 24; buzzing in the ears on the 27th; epistaxis and
                                        delirium on the 29th, the former recurring on the 31st and
                                        on November 3 and 4. On Oct. 30 the patient was kept from
                                        sleeping by the cough, and there was much delirium, deafness
                                        and tinnitus; at this time the tongue was dry and its
                                        papillæ prominent. On November 1 the tongue was
                                        swollen, dry and brown. On the 3d the deafness was very
                                        great, but a discharge occurred from the ear, and with this
                                        the tongue became moist and the deafness lessened. On the
                                        4th, when the last attack of epistaxis occurred, the pulse
                                        became so faint that it could scarcely be counted; but the
                                        appetite improved. On the 5th the tongue was moist and
                                        yellowish, pulse 100 and feeble; there was no abdominal
                                        tenderness and less cough. On the 8th the pulse was 105 and
                                        the respiration 22. Next day the pulse was 120. Death took
                                        place on <date type="death" when="1861-11-12">the 12th</date> with pneumonic symptoms. </p>
