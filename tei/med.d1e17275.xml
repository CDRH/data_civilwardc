                                                  however, were not injured. He was treated in a
                                                  field hospital, and, on <date type="transfer" when="1864-05-15">May 15th</date>, was sent to the
                                                                  <name type="hospital" key="157">Columbian Hospital</name> at Washington. He was pale,
                                                  emaciated, and complained of acute cephalalgia;
                                                  otherwise, his bodily functions were normal. On
                                                  the 17th, the headache had increased, and the
                                                  pupils had become contracted. Expectant treatment
                                                  was used, notwithstanding which, delirium
                                                  gradually came on, and, on May 20th, the patient
                                                  was comatose and unable to swallow. The pulsations
                                                  of the heart were rapid and feeble; the pulse at
                                                  the wrist, imperceptible. He remained in this
                                                  condition sixty hours, when it was found that if
                                                  fluids were placed in his mouth in small
                                                  quantities, he would swallow them. From this time
                                                  he slowly improved. On June 2d, the patient was
                                                  able to sit up, but his bowels were constipated,
                                                  he voided his urine unconsciously, and his mental
                                                  faculties were much impaired. He was unable to
                                                  articulate, had no recollection of the past or
                                                  proper perception of present things, and stared
                                                  vacantly round the tent. His appetite was
                                                  ravenous. The pupil of the right eye did not
                                                  respond to light; otherwise, there was no
                                                  paralysis. At this date, a h&#230;morrhage occurred
                                                  from the posterior wound to the amount of about
                                                  two ounces, followed by great improvement in all
                                                  the symptoms. H&#230;morrhage recurred every two or
                                                  three days, and was not altogether checked until
                                                  the <date type="operation" when="1864-06-18">18th of June</date>, as it seemed to aid much in
                                                  restoring his mental faculties. On the latter date, an attempt
                                                  was made to ligate the temporal artery; and this
                                                  failing, the common carotid was ligated at its
                                                  upper portion, on <date type="operation" when="1864-06-20">June 20th</date>, by <name type="person">Surgeon T. R. Crosby</name>, <name type="organization" key="132">U. S. V.</name> The bleeding still continuing,
                                                  the posterior wound was enlarged, and some small
                                                  fragments of exfoliated bone were removed; the
                                                  wound was then plugged with lint, which entirely
                                                  arrested the h&#230;morrhage. It was estimated that
                                                  fifty ounces of blood had been lost during the
                                                  last h&#230;morrhage. Liberal diet was prescribed, and
                                                  the patient gained rapidly in flesh. The ligature
                                                  came away on the tenth day after the operation,
                                                  and the wound united, except at the point of
                                                  ligation, where a fistulous opening remained,
                                                  which discharged daily a small amount of pus. On
                                                                <date type="operation" when="1864-08-15">August 15th</date>, blood was found to ooze from the
                                                  place of ligation; and, the patient having lost
                                                  about twenty ounces, the artery was cut down upon
                                                  by <name type="person">Surgeon Crosby</name> and ligated below the omo-hyoid
                                                  muscle. The vessel was found dilated to more than
                                                  double its normal size, and firmly attached to it,
                                                  on the inner side, was a well-formed clot. Low
                                                  diet was ordered; tincture of aconite was given
                                                  to keep the heart's action as much reduced as was
                                                  consistent with the safety of the patient. On
                                                  September 15th, the wound had fully healed, and,
                                                  on <date type="furlough" when="1864-11-15">November 15th</date>, the patient was furloughed,
                                                  apparently entirely restored in his bodily
                                                  functions. He was discharged from service on <date type="servicedischarge" when="1865-06-08">June
                                                  8th, 1865</date>. The case is reported by <name type="person">Surgeon T. R. Crosby</name>, <name type="organization" key="132">U. S. V.</name>, and is figured as No. 284,
