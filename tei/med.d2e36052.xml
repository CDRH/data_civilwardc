                                        headache, for the relief of which ten grains of blue-pill,
                                        with castor oil to follow, were prescribed. During the night
                                        the bowels were freely opened and next day the headache was
                                        relieved; but the patient complained of uneasiness or

                                        and no expectoration; pulse 100, rather small and compressible. Quinine, stimulants and nutrients were freely
                                        administered, but without effect; the patient died <date type="death" when="1865-04-10">towards
