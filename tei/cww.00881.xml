                    Where the value of the service of more than one person is claimed in the same
                    petition, the form must be modified and adapted to the circumstances of the
                    case:]</ab>
                <p rend="bold">To the Commissioners under the act of Congress approved the <date when="1862-04-16">16th of April, 1862</date>, entitled "An act for the
                    release of certain persons held to service or labor in the <placeName>District

                <p>Your Petitioner, <seg type="handwritten"><persName>Anna M. Hamilton</persName> of
                            <placeName>Illinois</placeName></seg> by this <seg type="handwritten">her</seg> petition in writing, represents and states, that <seg type="handwritten">she</seg> is a person loyal to the <placeName>United
                        States</placeName>, who, at the time of the passage of the said act of
                    Congress, held a claim to service or labor against <seg type="handwritten">—</seg> a person of African descent of the name of <seg type="handwritten"><persName>Harriet Chase</persName></seg> for and during
                    the life of said <seg type="handwritten">person</seg> and that by said act of
                    Congress said <seg type="handwritten">person</seg> was discharged and freed of
                    and from all claim of your petitioner to such service or labor; that at the time
                    of said discharge said <seg type="handwritten">person</seg> was of the age of
                        <seg type="handwritten">about forty years</seg> and of the personal
                    description following:<note type="government" place="foot" xml:id="n1">Here
                        describe the person, so as to identify him or her; and if there be more than
                        one slave, describe each one separately.</note>
                    <seg type="handwritten">In height about five feet five inches, &amp; of light
                        complexion &amp; of pleasant countenance no marks known or
                        recollected)</seg></p>

                <p>That your petitioner acquired <seg type="handwritten">her</seg> claim to the
                    aforesaid service or labor of said <seg type="handwritten">person</seg> in
                    manner following:<note type="government" place="foot" xml:id="n2">Here state how
                        the claim was acquired, when, from whom, and for what price or
                        consideration; and, if held under any written evidence of title, make
                        exhibit thereof, or refer to the public record where the same may be
                        found.</note>
                    <seg type="handwritten">She is the widow of <persName>Samuel
                        Hamilton</persName>, late of <placeName>Prince Georges County</placeName>,
                            <placeName>Maryland</placeName>, and she received this woman as a part
                        of her thirds in said Estate, as his widow &amp; about five years
                    ago</seg></p>

                <p>That your petitioner's claim to the service or labor of said <seg type="handwritten">person</seg> was, at the time of said discharge
                    therefrom, of the value of <seg type="handwritten">Seven hundred</seg> dollars
                    in money.<note type="government" place="foot" xml:id="n3">Here state such facts,
                        if any there be, touching the value of the petitioner's claim to the service
                        or labor of the person, as may enhance the same, and also such facts, if
                        any, touching the moral, mental, and bodily infirmities or defects of said
                        person, as impair the value of the petitioner's claim to such service or
                        labor, and conclude such statement with an averment that the petitioner
                        knows of no other infirmities or defects of said person which impair the
                        value of petitioner's claim to such service or labor, and that he believes
                        none other to exist. If the petitioner specify no such infirmity or defect,
                        then his statement touching the value of his claim should conclude with an
                        averment that he has no knowledge of any such infirmity or
                        defect.</note><seg type="handwritten">She has earned five dollars a month as
                        cook, and house servant,—for the last few years she has been
                        chambermaid—a very good &amp; trusty servant in all these capacities.
                        Her health has not been very good, tho' I cannot state the cause. She has no
                        mental or moral defect or infirmity—nor bodily, as far as I know or
                        believe, except as before stated that her health has not been
                    good.</seg></p>

                <p>Your petitioner hereby declares that <seg type="handwritten">she</seg> bears true
                    and faithful allegiance to the Government of the <placeName>United
                        States</placeName>, and that <seg type="handwritten">she</seg> has not borne
                    arms against the <placeName>United States</placeName> in the present rebellion,
                    nor in any way given aid or comfort thereto.</p>

                <p>And your petitioner further states and alleges, that <seg type="handwritten">she</seg> has not brought said <seg type="handwritten">woman</seg> into the
                        <placeName>District of Columbia</placeName> since the passage of said act of
                    Congress; and that, at the time of the passage thereof, said <seg type="handwritten">woman</seg> was held to service or labor therein under
                    and by virtue of your petitioner's claim to such service or labor.</p>

                <p>Your petitioner further states and alleges, that <seg type="handwritten">her</seg> said claim to the service or labor of said <seg type="handwritten">woman</seg> does not originate in or by virtue of any
                    transfer heretofore made by any person who has in any manner aided or sustained
                    the present rebellion against the Government of the <placeName>United
                        States</placeName>.</p>

                <p>And your petitioner prays the said Commissioners to investigate and determine the
                    validity of <seg type="handwritten">her</seg> said claim to the service or labor
                    of said <seg type="handwritten">woman</seg> herein above set forth; and if the
                    same be found to be valid, that they appraise and apportion the value of said
                    claim in money, and report the same to the Secretary of the Treasury of the
                        <placeName>United States</placeName>, in conformity to the provisions of
                    said act of Congress.</p>
