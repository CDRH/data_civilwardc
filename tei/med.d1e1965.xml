                                head, back and shoulders, slight fever, epistaxis and diarrh&#339;a.
                                He was admitted on <date type="admit" when="1861-09-09">the
                                        9th</date> as a case of typhoid fever. The patient was weak;
                                his tongue coated at the base, pale at tip and moist; skin hot and
                                dry, showing a profusion of rose-colored spots; his cheeks were
                                flushed, quite red, and he had cough and hoarseness, but his bowels
                                were quiet. Dover's powder was given. He rested well, but next
                                morning the fever ran high; pulse 104; skin hot and dry; face much
                                flushed; tongue purple at the tip, coated, pale; large numbers of
                                rose-spots on the abdomen, thighs and back, disappearing on
                                pressure; one thin stool; borborygmus; anorexia. Squill and tartar
                                emetic were given to allay the cough. In the evening the flushed
                                condition of the face continued and the patient became
                                drowsy,&#8212;pulse 108, but the skin began to be moist; four small
                                thin stools were passed; but there was no abdominal pain, tenderness
                                nor borborygmus. Next day the skin was perspiring and covered with
                                rose-spots, the pulse had fallen to 92, and the patient's drowsiness
                                was dissipated and his cough lessened; he had epistaxis. In the
                                evening he sat up for a short time. On the 12th he had four small
                                stools and some tympanites, but no pain nor tenderness. In the
                                evening the face was flushed, eyes injected, skin hot and dry, but
                                the mind perfectly clear. The diarrh&#339;a abated gradually, and on
                                the 15th he had one natural passage; on which day the skin was in
                                natural condition, the tongue dark-red and slightly coated and the
                                mind clear; the patient's face was flushed, and he had some cough
                                and hoarseness; the rose-spots continued on the surface and did not
                                disappear finally until the 20th. On the 22d the patient complained of dysuria, occurring
                                suddenly after beginning to urinate, and accompanied by the passage
                                of a few drops of blood and pain in the end of the penis; this
                                continued more or less until the 30th. On October 2 he was employed
                                in light duty about the ward, and was returned to duty on <date
