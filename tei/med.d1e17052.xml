            <p><hi rend="initialcap">C</hi>ASE.&#8212;<name type="person">Private Owen Fitzpatrick</name>, <name type="organization">Co. B, 63d New York Volunteers</name>, aged 48 years,
                was wounded at the battle of <name type="BATTLE" key="259">the Wilderness, Virginia</name>, <date type="injury" when="1864-05-05">May 5th, 1864</date>, by a
                    musket ball, which struck anterior to the superior angle of the occipital bone,
                    fracturing both tables of the skull and depressing a portion of the bone to the
                    extent of one-fourth of an inch. He was conveyed to <name type="place">Alexandria, Virginia</name>, and
                entered the <name type="hospital" key="189">3d division hospital</name> on <date type="admit" when="1864-05-12">May 12th</date>. Little, if any, constitutional
                    disturbance existed; the patient ate and slept well and was able to walk about.
                    On <date type="operation" when="1864-05-16">the 16th</date>, he was placed under the influence of chloroform and ether, equal
                    parts, and <name type="person" key="134">Surgeon Edwin Bentley</name>, <name type="organization" key="132">U. S. V.</name>, trephined the skull, removed a few
                    small fragments, and elevated the depressed bone. No h&#230;morrhage followed the
                    operation. Cold water dressings were applied, the head slightly elevated, and
                    quiet and abstemious diet strictly enjoined. The case progressed without any
                    untoward symptoms. On <date type="operation" when="1864-06-25">June 25th</date>, some small pieces of skull and shreds of cloth were removed from the wound. On <date type="furlough" when="1864-09-26">September
                    26th</date>, the wound had entirely healed and the patient received a furlough of
                thirty days, at the expiration of which he returned. On <date type="servicedischarge" when="1864-12-20">December 20th, 1864</date>, he
                    was discharged from the service on surgeon's certificate of disability, by
                    reason of dizziness and headache which supervened any exercise. A communication
                    from the <name type="organization">Commissioner of Pensions</name>, dated <date type="pension" when="1868-01-03">January 3d, 1868</date>, states that
                    Fitzpatrick is a pensioner, and that his disability is rated as one-half and
                    permanent. The case is reported by <name type="person" key="134">Surgeon E. Bentley</name>, <name type="organization" key="132">U. S. V.</name>  On <date type="pension" when="1870-01-28">January 28th,
                        1870</date>, <name type="person">Pension Examiner J. W. Foward</name> reports from the National Military Asylum at
                    Augusta, Maine, (of which institution the patient was an inmate,) that there was
                    a deep indentation at the seat of the wound. There was complete loss of sight of
                    left eye and the vision of the right eye was much impaired. The patient suffered
                    from headache, dizziness, temporary loss of sight of right eve, and was unable
                    to remain in the sun or perform any labor requiring stooping or much exertion.
                    Since he was wounded he was subject to fits of an epileptiform character, which
                    supervened upon unusual exertion. His disability is rated total and
                    permanent. </p>
