      Miller</name>, <name type="organization" key="328">Co. G, 124th New York</name>, aged 27
     years, was wounded at <name type="BATTLE" key="10">Chancellorsville</name>, <date
      type="injury" when="1863-05-03">May 3, 1863</date>, by a mini&#233; ball, which entered the left
     knee one-half inch external to the inner condyle of the femur and emerged two inches
     anteriorly, bruising the bone. <name type="person" key="123">Surgeon D. W. Bliss</name>, <name
      type="organization" key="132">U. S. V.</name>, reported his admission to <name type="place" key="#Washington">Washington</name>, <date type="admit" when="1863-05-08">May 8th</date>, with the knee joint in a
     swollen condition. Irrigation was made by water dressings, and subsequently tincture of iodine
     was applied to the knee. By June 6th the wound had nearly healed, but there was considerable
     effusion in the joint and contraction of the flexor tendons. The patient subsequently passed
     through several hospitals, was assigned to the <name type="organization" key="109">Veteran Reserve
      Corps</name> <date type="duty" when="1864-03-02">March 2, 1864</date>, and ultimately discharged <date
      type="servicedischarge" when="1865-08-13">August 13, 1865</date>, and pensioned. Examining
     surgeons report swelling of the knee, owing partly to enlargement of bone and partly to
     &#339;dematous condition of the tissues; also anchylosis from injury of the bony structures and
     from contraction of the tendons and ligaments. </p>
