                                                                                1864</date>, from the <name type="place">Orange and Alexandria Railroad depot</name>, with a pistol shot wound of the left side
                                                  of the spine, fracturing the twelfth dorsal
                                                  vertebra, said to have been received in action.
                                                  When admitted, he was much depressed; pulse about
                                                  130; tongue very thick and heavily coated; a great
                                                  deal of pain over the abdomen and right side. His
                                                  bowels had not moved for three days. There was
                                                  incontinence of urine. All below a direct line
                                                  from wound to pubis was paraplegic. About three
                                                  pints of very thick and dark-colored urine were
                                                  drawn off with a catheter. Stimulants, tonics, and
                                                  a cathartic were given, with an anodyne at night.
                                                  Under this treatment, he began to improve, and did
                                                  well until <date type="injury" when="1864-11-15">November 15th</date>, when a bad cough set in.
                                                                On <date type="death" when="1864-11-18">the 18th</date>, in a fit of violent coughing,
                                                  h&#230;moptysis occurred to the amount of a quart.
                                                  Death occurred in one-half hour afterward. At the
                                                  necropsy, upon opening the spinal column
                                                  posteriorly from the second dorsal vertebra to the
                                                  sacrum, the muscular tissue in the lumbar region
                                                  was found to be very dark and softened. No
                                                  abscesses or infiltrated pus could be detected in
                                                  it. Upon removing the spinal cord the dura mater
                                                  was found congested and firmly adherent to the
                                                  vertebrae. The substance of the cord looked very
                                                  red. The ball had passed between the arches of the
                                                  twelfth dorsal and the first lumbar vertebrae,
                                                  then through the body of the twelfth dorsal on the
                                                  right side, outside of the spinal meninges. Its
                                                  further track could not be traced. In making this
                                                  examination, the cavity of the right pleura was
                                                  opened and from it escaped about three pints of
