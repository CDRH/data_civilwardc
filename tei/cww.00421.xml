                        and honesty, which principles she had endeavored to instill in the minds of
                        her children. The worth of these Servants to me, especially
                            <persName>Susan</persName>, can not be estimated by dollars and cents. I
                        would again State that I have no knowledge of their having any bodily or

                    was held to service or labor therein under and by virtue of your petitioner's
                    claim to such service or labor.</p>

                <p>Your petitioner further states and alleges, that <seg type="handwritten">her</seg> said claim to the service or labor of said <seg type="handwritten">

                <p>And your petitioner prays the said Commissioners to investigate and determine the
