                    <date type="death" when="1865-08-14">August 14th, 1865</date>. There was no
                external evidence of depression or fracture of the skull, but simply a severe
                contusion of the forehead. The autopsy revealed a three-branched linear fracture of

                centre of the superior border of the bone downward and outward through the right
                frontal eminence. From the upper third of this fissure a second fissure passes
                nearly at right angles downward through the left frontal eminence. This last fissure
                involves the external table only. The inner table is fissured to correspond with the
                first line of fracture, and there is also a short fissure branching upward. The
                inner table opposite each frontal eminence is reticulated, and in the centre of the
                perforated plate on the left side there is a small nodule of bone of the size of a
                grain of wheat. The specimen, with a memorandum of the case, was forwarded to the
