     Dietz</name>, <name type="organization" key="238">Co. B, 48th Pennsylvania</name>, aged 21
    years, was wounded in the left ankle joint, at <name type="BATTLE" key="3"><choice>

      <reg>Spotsylvania</reg>
     </choice></name>, <date type="injury" when="1864-05-12">May 12, 1864</date>. He remained at a
    field hospital for <date type="transfer" when="1864-05-26">two weeks</date> and was then
    conveyed to <name type="place" key="#Washington">Washington</name>, where he was admitted to
     <name type="hospital" key="174">Campbell Hospital</name>. <name type="person" key="74">Surgeon
     A. F. Sheldon</name>, <name type="organization" key="132">U. S. V.</name>, contributed the
    pathological specimen, No. 4032, represented in the annexed wood-cut (<hi rend="initialcap"
     >F</hi>IG. 324), with the following history of the injury: "A musket ball entered the left foot
    posteriorly, passed forward between the <choice>
     <orig>astragalus</orig>
     <reg>talus</reg>
    </choice> and tibia, and emerged anteriorly, opposite the point of entrance, fracturing the
    articulating surfaces of both bones. Circular amputation through the inferior third of the leg
    was performed by <name type="person" key="1306">Assistant Surgeon A. Delany</name>, <name
     type="organization" key="132">U. S. V.</name>, on <date type="operation" when="1864-11-10"
     >November 10th</date>, two ligatures being applied and an&#230;sthesia produced by chloroform.
    At the time of the operation the foot and ankle were enlarged, with numerous openings
    discharging sanguinolent pus. Hectic irritation, pain, and loss of appetite were rapidly
    overcoming what little vitality remained. The patient bore the operation well." The patient was
    subsequently transferred to <name type="person" key="428">Judiciary Square Hospital</name> for
    the purpose of being fitted with an artificial limb, and on <date type="servicedischarge"
     when="1865-05-19">May 19, 1865</date>, he was discharged from service and pensioned. In his
    application for commutation, dated <date type="pension" when="1870">1870</date>, he described
    the stump as "healed and well," and subsequently he reported it as being in "good condition."
    The pensioner was paid <date type="pension" when="1880-06-04">June 4, 1880</date>. The specimen
    consists of the bones comprising the ankle of the amputated leg, and shows that large quantities
    of spongy new bone were thrown out around the tibia, but the bodies of the bones were destroyed
    by suppuration. </p>
