Y.</name>; age 24; enlisted in <date type="enlisted" when="1864-09">September, 1864</date>; admitted <date type="admit" when="1864-11-30">November 30</date>. He stated that about <date type="injury" when="1864-10-15">the middle of October</date>, after exposure to excessive
                                        fatigue and cold, he was attacked with violent fever and was
                                        unconscious for ten or twelve days. On regaining
                                        consciousness he had lost the use of his legs.  When
                                        admitted he was in fair condition excepting the paralysis;
                                        there was tenderness on pressure along the entire spine. His
                                        condition remained unchanged during December; the
                                        innervation of the lower extremities did not improve; the
                                        skin was without sensation; there was no pain or uneasiness
                                        other than an occasional pricking and numb sensation in the
                                        thigh.  During January, 1865, he complained of frequent
                                        headache and much pain in the groins and testicles, darting
                                        up the back; the appetite failed and the muscles of the
                                        lower extremities became soft and atrophied. In February the
                                        left arm and forearm became numb and stiff, but this
                                        afterwards in a measure disappeared.  The patient gradually
                                        became an&#230;mic. Counter-irritation was applied along the
                                        spine, stimulating friction to the limbs and passive motion
                                        to the joints; purgatives and alteratives were given,
                                        iodide of iron particularly; nux vomica was also used, but
                                        cautiously, as it appeared to aggravate the spinal
                                        excitement and pain; anodynes and wine were employed.  He
                                        was discharged from service <date type="servicedischarge" when="1865-03-07">March 7</date>.&#8212;<hi rend="italic"><name type="hospital" key="189">Third Division Hospital</name>, <name type="place">Alexandria, Va.</name></hi> </p>
