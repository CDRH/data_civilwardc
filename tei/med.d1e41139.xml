The brain was apparently healthy, and weighed fifty-two ounces and a half; the ventricles contained two drachms of turbid serum tinged with blood. The trachea was slightly purplish toward its bifurcation, but pale elsewhere. The right lung weighed sixteen ounces; the posterior portion of its upper and the whole of its lower lobe were in the stage of red hepatization; the left lung weighed fifteen ounces; it was crepitant throughout; its bronchial tubes contained a pus-like secretion. The pericardium contained a drachm of fluid. The heart was healthy; there was a small white clot in the right side, none in the left. The liver was dark-brown in color, of normal consistence, and weighed forty ounces; the gall-bladder contained ten drachms of molasses-colored viscid bile. The spleen was firm, of a dark mahogany color, and weighed four ounces and a half. The pancreas weighed two ounces. The kidneys were healthy; the right weighed three ounces, the left three and a half. The large intestine was extensively ulcerated, presenting the appearance of one large roughened ulcer.&#8212;<name type="person" key="245">Assistant Surgeon Harrison Allen</name>, <name type="organization" key="190">U.

   <p>&#8432; September 14, 1864, <name type="person" key="245">Dr. Allen</name> presented to the Pathological Society of Philadelphia a brief &#34;<hi rend="italic">Synopsis of Autopsies made at <name type="hospital" key="176">Lincoln General Hospital</name></hi>,&#34; to which the reader is referred.&#8212;(Proceedings of the Pathological Society of Philadelphia, in the American Journal of the Medical Sciences, January, 1865, page 133.)  In this paper he analyzes the appearances observed in forty-one cases of diarrh&#339;a and dysentery, thirty-five of fever, twenty-one of pneumonia, and five of diphtheria. The notes of <name type="person" key="245">Dr. Allen</name>'s autopsies, from which the accounts here presented have been condensed, were not contained in the case-books of <name type="hospital" key="176">Lincoln hospital</name> turned in to the <name type="organization" key="xxx">Surgeon General's Office</name> at the close of the war, but have since been copied into them from the originals, loaned for the purpose.</p>
