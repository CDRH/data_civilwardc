        <hi rend="initialcap">C</hi>ASE.&#8212;<name type="person" key="xxx">Captain Robert
          S&#8212;&#8212;</name>, <name type="organization" key="xxx">Co. A, 29th New York
          Volunteers</name>, was wounded at <name type="BATTLE" key="257">Chancellorsville</name>,
        on <date type="injury" when="1863-05-02">May 2d, 1863</date>. A round musket ball, fired
        from a distance of about one hundred and fifty yards, entered the eighth intercostal space
        of the left side, at a point nine and one-half inches to the left of the extremity of the
        ensiform cartilage, and fractured the ninth rib. Without wounding the lung apparently, the
        ball passed through the diaphragm, and entered some portion of the alimentary canal. Captain
        S. walked a mile and a half to the rear, and entered a field hospital. On examining his
        wound, the surgeons found a protrusion of the lung of the size of a small orange, which they
        unavailingly attempted to reduce. The wound was enlarged, and still it was impracticable to
        replace the protruded lung. On <date type="transfer" when="1863-05-03">May 3d</date>, the
        field hospital, where Captain S. lay, was exposed to the enemy's fire. He walked half a mile
        further to the rear, and was there placed in an ambulance, and taken across the <name
          type="place">Rappahannock</name>, at <name type="place">United States Ford</name>, to one
        of the base hospitals. Here fruitless efforts were again made to reduce the hernial tumor,
        after which a ligature was thrown around its base and tightened. <date type="transfer"
          when="1863-05-05">A day or two subsequently</date>, the patient passed into the hospital
        of the 2d division of the Eleventh Corps, into the hands of <name type="person" key="xxx"
          >Surgeon Robert Thomain</name>, <name type="organization" key="xxx">29th New York
          Volunteers</name>, who removed the ligature from the base of the tumor. A small portion of
        gangrenous lung separated and left a clean granulating surface beneath. On <date
          type="injury" when="1863-05-07">May 7th</date>, the ball was voided at stool. On May 8th,
        the patient was visited by <name type="person" key="288">Surgeon John H. Brinton</name>,
          <name type="organization" key="132">U. S. V.</name>, who found him walking about the ward,
        smoking a cigar. There was an entire absence of general constitutional symptoms; no cough,
        no dyspn&#339;a, no abdominal pain; the bowels were regular and appetite good. The
        protruding portion of the lung was carnified; there was a <choice>
          <orig>dulness</orig>
          <reg>dullness</reg>
        </choice> on percussion, and absence of the respiratory murmur in a zone an inch and a half
        in width around the circumference of the base of the tumor. <name type="person">Surgeon <choice>
            <sic>Thomaine</sic>
            <reg>Thomain</reg>
          </choice></name> stated that the hernia had been gradually diminishing in volume. It was,
        at this date, half the size of an egg, and covered with florid granulations. On <date
          type="injury" when="1863-05-10">May 10th</date>, a drawing of the parts was executed by
          <name type="person" key="xxx">Mr. Stanch</name>, artist of the <name type="hospital"
          key="431">Army Medical Museum</name>. (See Chromolithograph No. XI.) On <date
          type="transfer" when="1863-06-02">June 2d</date>, Captain S. was transferred to <name
          type="place" key="#Washington">Washington</name>. There was an elastic, partly reducible
        tumor, over which was an oval granulating surface an inch and a half by three-fourths of an
        inch. The vesicular murmur was perfect throughout the lung, except in the immediate vicinity
        of the tumor. Compression of the tumor was advised. After a furlough of sixty days, Captain
        S. was again examined. The wound had entirely healed; the respiratory sounds were normal;
        there was still a slight hernia of the lung. The general health of the patient was
        excellent. At <date type="injury" when="1863-08">this date</date> a second drawing was
        executed. (See Chromolithograph No. XII.) The captain was discharged from service on <date
          type="servicedischarge" when="1863-06-20">June 20th, 1863</date>, and was subsequently
        pensioned. On <date type="pension" when="1864-05-19">May 19th, 1864</date>, <name
          type="person" key="xxx">Pension Examiner E. Swift</name> reports the patient to he
        entirely incapacitated from the wound, which, at that date, was considerably tumefied. He
        rates his disability total and temporary. <date type="pension" when="1865-09-19">September
          19th, 1865</date>: The tumor is reported to be undiminished in size and painless. The
        patient can take ordinary, leisurely exercise, but is unable to run up and down stairs. He
        has no cough, but suffers somewhat from gastric symptoms, his stomach being easily
        disturbed. The extra-thoracic tumor is resonant on percussion. The air, in entering,
        produces a crepitant crack ling sound; the expiratory murmur is feeble. <date type="pension"
          when="1867-03-19">March 14th, 1867</date>: Two months ago, the tumor suddenly enlarged
        after straining efforts at lifting, being now five inches in its long and four and a half
        inches in its transverse diameter. The respiratory sounds are feeble. There is often nausea
        after eating, and great pain, referred to the tumor. Pressure over the tumor causes a
        gurgling sound, simulating the presence of air within the tumor, and borborygamus throughout
        the intestines. The patient declares his inability to eat meat. The contents of the tumor
        are not reducible; traction on it and its contents produce nausea. A portion of the stomach
        has undoubtedly escaped through the diaphragm, and through the opening in the thoracic
        walls. A bandage, so arranged as to retain the tumor within its present limits and prevent
        further enlargement, was applied. A letter from the patient, dated<date type="pension"
          when="1870-01-23"> January 23d, 1870</date>, leads us to infer that this bandage has
        fulfilled its indication. On <date type="pension" when="1870-01-31">January 31st,
          1870</date>, the patient was reported to have, in addition to his other troubles, a hernia
        of the stomach, which viscus passed up through the diaphragm and thence through the opening
        in the rib, so that the tumor on the left side contained both lung and stomach. He wore a
        compressing bandage. On <date type="pension" when="1872-07-20">July 20th, 1872</date>, <name
          type="person" key="xxx">Dr. Wm. H. Romig</name>, of <name type="place">Allentown,
          Pennsylvania</name>, the family physician of <name type="person" key="xxx">Captain
          Stolpe</name>, writes : &#34;The hernial tumor is of a doughy consistence, its surface
        smooth, measures in its longest diameter four and a half inches. Stolpe says, it appears
        smaller at times; it cannot be reduced by taxis, neither can any communication be discovered
        with the internal organs. Never gives pain, but dyspn&#339;a is produced upon hastening his
        pace or heavy lifting; cannot lie on his left side for same reason; cannot expand his lung
        fully, that is, beyond normal use. His stomach will take food often, but not much at a time;
        the left side of his body does not appear so strong as the right. Weighs about one hundred
        and sixty pounds, and enjoys good health.&#34; </p>
