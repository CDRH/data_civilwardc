                <p>To the Commissioners under the Act of Congress approved <date when="1862-04-16">April 16: 1862</date>, entitled "An Act for the release of certain persons

                <p>Your petitioner, <persName>Samuel Higgins</persName> of <placeName>Montgomery
                        County</placeName>
                    <placeName>State of Maryland</placeName>, by this his petition in writing shows
                    and states, that he is a person loyal to the <placeName>United
                        States</placeName> who at the time of the passage of the said Act of
                    Congress held a claim to service or labor against two persons of African descent
                    of the names of <persName><hi rend="underline">Lucy</hi></persName> and (her
                    daughter) <persName><hi rend="underline">Lucinda</hi></persName>, for and during
                    the life of said <persName>Lucy</persName> and said
                    <persName>Lucinda</persName>; and that by said Act of Congress said
                        <persName>Lucy</persName> and said <persName>Lucinda</persName> were
                    discharged and made free of and from all claim of your petitioner to such
                    service or labor; that at the time of said discharge said <persName><hi rend="underline">Lucy</hi></persName> was of or about the age of forty
                    eight years, of a dark color, about five feet six inches high, thick set, and of
                    a sprightly appearance; said <persName><hi rend="underline">Lucinda</hi></persName> was of or about the age of eight years, of light
                    color about three feet six inches tall, and well built.</p>

                <p>That your petitioner acquired his claim to the aforesaid service or labor of the

                        <persName>Lucinda</persName> under and by virtue of a deed of conveyance
                    from <persName>John T. Vincent</persName> of <placeName>Montgomery
                        County</placeName>
                    <placeName>Maryland</placeName> to and in favor of your petitioner bearing date
                        <space atLeast="1"/>
                    <date when="1855">1855</date>, and duly recorded<pb xml:id="leaf001v" facs="cww.00821.002.jpg"/> among the Land Records of the Circuit Court for
                        <placeName>Montgomery County</placeName>
                    <placeName>Maryland</placeName>.</p>

                <p>That your petitioner's claim to the service or labor of said
                        <persName>Lucy</persName> and said <persName>Lucinda</persName> was at the
                    time of said discharge therefrom of the value of <hi rend="underline">Six
                        hundred</hi> dollars in money for said <persName><hi rend="underline">Lucy</hi></persName>, and of the value of <hi rend="underline">Four hundred</hi> dollars in money for said <persName><hi rend="underline">Lucinda</hi></persName>.</p>

                <p>Your petitioner avers, that said <persName>Lucy</persName> is a strong, active,
                    industrious and very valuable person capable of performing and who has performed
                    the most efficient and valuable service and labor as a domestic in several
                    households in <placeName>Geo. Town</placeName> in said District during the five
                    years she has been hired therein, and that said <persName>Lucinda</persName> is
                    a smart active well built child, and valuable as any one of her age of eight
                    years can be.</p>

                <p>And your petitioner avers that he knows of no moral mental or bodily infirmities
                    or defects which can impair the value of your petitioner's claim to said service
                    of labor.</p>

                <p>Your petitioner hereby declares that he bears true and faithful allegiance to the
                    government of the <placeName>United States</placeName>, and that he has not
                    borne arms against the <placeName>United States</placeName> in the present
                    rebellion, nor in any way given aid or comfort thereto.</p>

                <p>And your petitioner further states and avers that he has not brought said
                            <persName><hi rend="underline">Lucy</hi></persName> or said
                            <persName><hi rend="underline">Lucinda</hi></persName> into the
                        <placeName>District of Columbia</placeName> since the passage of said Act of
                    Congress; and that at<pb xml:id="leaf002r" facs="cww.00821.003.jpg"/> the time
                    of the passage thereof, said <persName><hi rend="underline">Lucy</hi></persName>
                    and said <persName><hi rend="underline">Lucinda</hi></persName> were held to
                    service or labor therein under and by virtue of your petitioner's claim to such
                    service or labor.</p>

                <p>Your petitioner further states and avers that his said claim to the service or
                    labor of said <persName>Lucy</persName> and said <persName>Lucinda</persName>
                    does not originate in or by virtue of any transfer heretofore made by any person
                    who has in any manner aided or sustained the present rebellion against the
                    government of the <placeName>United States</placeName>.</p>

                <p>And your petitioner prays the said Commissioners to investigate and determine the
                    validity of his said claim to the service or labor of said
                        <persName>Lucy</persName> and said <persName>Lucinda</persName> herein above
                    set forth; and if the same be found valid that they appraise and apportion the
                    value of said claim in money and report the same to the Secretary of the
                    Treasury of the <placeName>United States</placeName> in conformity to the
                    provisions of said Act of Congress.</p>
