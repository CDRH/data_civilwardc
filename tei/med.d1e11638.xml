                                        awaiting transportation to his regiment in Virginia, he was
                                        much exposed to the weather, having to sleep in the snow. He
                                        was sick when he joined his regiment, <date type="injury" when="1864-03-24">March 24</date>, having

                                        thirst and extreme tenderness of the chest and abdomen. On

                                        prescribed. Eggnog was added to the treatment on the 5th,
                                        and on the following day, as the diarrh&#339;a persisted, an
