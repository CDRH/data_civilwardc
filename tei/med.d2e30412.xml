     Crawford</name>, <name type="organization" key="xxx">Co. K, 51st New York</name>, aged 17
    years, was wounded in the left arm, at <name type="BATTLE" key="127">Manassas</name>, <date
     type="injury" when="1862-08-30">August 30, 1862</date>, and entered <name type="hospital"

     C. Page</name>, <name type="organization" key="190">U. S. A.</name>, reported: &#34;Gunshot
    wound through left elbow joint, ball entering nearly over and somewhat toward the outer edge of
    the coronoid process of the ulna and emerging behind the olecranon. The wound was explored on
     <date type="operation" when="1862-09-16">September 16th</date>, when entire comminution of the
    joint was discovered. The arm was amputated at the middle third of the humerus, on <date
     type="operation" when="1862-10-07">October 7th</date>, by <name type="person" key="xxx">Acting
     Assistant Surgeon F. H. Brown</name>. Ether was used.&#34; The specimen (<hi rend="initialcap"
     >F</hi>IG. 556) was contributed by <name type="person" key="xxx">the operator</name>, and
    consists of &#34;the lowest third of the left humerus and upper halves of the bones of the
    forearm. &#42; &#42; A nearly longitudinal fracture has split off the lower and outer four
    inches of the humerus; the tip of the olecranon is fractured, and the articular surfaces of the
    three bones are carious. A large fragment of the shaft has reunited with displacement. The
    epiphyseal lines are well shown.&#34;&#8212;(<hi rend="italic">Cat. Surg. Sect.</hi>, 1866, p.
    166.) On <date type="transfer" when="1863-03-28">March 28th</date>, the patient was transferred
    to Ladies Home, <name type="place">New York City</name>, whence he was transferred to the <name
     type="organization" key="109">Veteran Reserve Corps</name> on <date type="duty"
     when="1863-09-14">September 14, 1863</date>. He was ultimately discharged on <date
     type="servicedischarge" when="1865-11-28">November 28, 1865</date>, and pensioned. An
    artificial arm was furnished in <date type="pension" when="1864-05">May, 1864</date>, by <name
     type="person" key="xxx">Mr. Lincoln</name>, of <name type="place">Boston</name>, who reported
    that the amputation was performed by flap method. In his application for commutation, in <date

    performed, subsequent to the amputation, by <name type="person" key="xxx">Surgeon A. B.
