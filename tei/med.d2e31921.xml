H, 116th Pennsylvania</name>, aged 30 years, having sustained a gunshot fracture of the left ilium at <name type="BATTLE" key="16">Cold Harbor</name> on <date type="injury" when="1864-06-03">June 3, 1864</date>, was sent to <name type="place" key="#Alexandria">Alexandria</name>, and admitted to <name type="hospital" key="188"><choice><sic>Sickles Hospital</sic><corr>Sickel Barracks General Hospital</corr></choice></name> on <date type="admit" when="1864-06-12">June 12, 1864</date>, in a weak and exhausted condition. Simple dressings were applied to the wound; tonics, stimulants, and anodynes were administered, and a full diet was allowed. A spicula of bone was removed on <date type="operation" when="1864-06-26">June 26th</date>, after which improvement took place. On July 14th, bed-sores appeared over the sacrum; on <date type="operation" when="1864-07-18">the 18th</date>, a large spicula of bone was removed from the left anterior superior spinous process of the ilium.  On August 2d, there was dysuria, with high-colored urine, which disappeared under appropriate treatment. On <date type="furlough" when="1864-08-17">August 17th</date>, the patient went to <name type="place">Philadelphia</name> on seven days leave of absence. His subsequent history is as follows: August 26th, sinking with exhaustion; wound has opened and discharges unhealthy pus; bed-sores increased in size and exceedingly foul.  <date type="injury" when="1864-09-01">September 1st</date>, py&#230;mia rapidly setting in: abscess appears before the anterior superior spinous process of the ilium.  Death occurred <date type="death" when="1864-09-08">September 8, 1864</date>.  At the autopsy, pus was found in the peritoneum, and a conoidal musket ball rested on the internal iliac muscle.  <name type="person" key="xxx">Acting Assistant Surgeon E. Neal</name> forwarded to <name type="hospital" key="431">the Museum</name> the pathological preparation, represented by the wood-cut (<hi rend="initialcap">F</hi>IGS. 147, 148).  &#34;The fragments are irregularly attached by callus, but the track of the ball is carious. The inner face of the ilium shows slight osseous deposits beyond the line of fracture.&#34;&#8212;(<hi rend="italic">Cat.</hi>, p. 227.)</p>
