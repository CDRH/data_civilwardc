     Biehl</name>, <name type="organization" key="xxx">Co. I, 155th Pennsylvania</name>, aged 27
    years, received a shot fracture of the right tibia, at <name type="BATTLE" key="7"
     >Petersburg</name>, <date type="injury" when="1864-06-19">June 19, 1864</date>. He was conveyed
    to the field hospital of the 1st division, Fifth Corps, where excision was performed but not
    recorded, and whence he was transferred to <name type="place">City Point</name> and subsequently
    to <name type="place">Alexandria</name>. <name type="person" key="134">Surgeon E.
    Bentley</name>, <name type="organization" key="132">U. S. V.</name>, who amputated the limb,
    reported the following history: &#34;The patient was admitted to the <name type="hospital"
     key="512">Third Division Hospital</name>
    <date type="transfer" when="1864-06-28">June 28th</date>. <choice>
     <orig>Exsection</orig>
     <reg>Excision</reg>
    </choice> had been performed on <date type="operation" when="1864-06-21">June 21st</date>, in
    the field, by <name type="person" key="xxx">Surgeon J. A. E. Read</name>, <name
     type="organization" key="xxx">155th Pennsylvania</name>, who removed two inches of the middle
    third of the tibia by a straight incision four inches in length. When admitted the lips of the
    wound were widely separated, having apparently never been brought together closely or supported
    except by straps and bandages. The incision remained open in its whole length, leaving a portion
    of the crest of each extremity exposed and uncovered of periosteum. The granulations were
    healthy and covered with laudable pus; but the leg and foot were badly swollen, particularly
    about the ankle, where the integument was &#339;dematous and pitted deeply on pressure. Water
    dressings were applied to the wound and stimulants were given internally. On <date type="injury"
     when="1864-07-14">July 14th</date>, gangrene appeared in the wound. Remedies used successfully
    in other cases signally failed in this. The disease extended along the medullary cavity of the
    bone and the muscles behind, seemingly bidding defiance to local applications and becoming very
    offensive. The patient sank very rapidly under the effects of the pain and poison, and the loss
    of blood from an artery opened by ulceration. On <date type="operation" when="1864-07-19">July
     19th</date>, amputation at the middle third of the thigh was performed by circular skin flaps.
    The patient was much prostrated at the time of the operation; had no appetite, great thirst, and
    dry tongue; face sunken and anxious; pulse quick and tremulous. Alcohol was applied to the
    stump, which was covered with a compress wet with the same. Whiskey and morphine was given
    internally. The next day gangrene attacked the stump, spreading rapidly on its face and
    extending three inches up the inner side of the thigh. The patient died on <date type="death"
     when="1864-07-21">July 21, 1864</date>, of exhaustion. The <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi>
    examination, twenty-two hours after death, revealed extensive gangrene of the stump and
    mortification extending to the body.&#34; The bones of the wounded leg, showing the tibia to be
    dead for one inch on each side of the excision, were contributed by <name type="person"
     key="134">Dr. Bentley</name> and are shown in the annexed cut (<hi rend="initialcap">F</hi>IG.
