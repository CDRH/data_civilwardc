                                age 24; was admitted from the <name type="organization" key="377">Army of the Potomac</name>, <date type="admit" when="1864-08-09">Aug. 9,
                                        1864</date>. The patient was scarcely able to raise himself in bed.
                                        His skin was covered with perspiration and sudamina, which
                                        in some places were on inflamed bases. He had diarrh&#339;a,
                                        cough and pain in the chest, but the chest symptoms were not
                                        of much severity. He lay upon either side without
                                        inconvenience, breathed regularly though rather slowly, and
                                        complained of distress only in the bowels. Astringents,
                                        opiates and stimulants, with counter-irritation, were
                                        employed.  He rallied for a day or two, but again grew worse,
                                        and died on <date type="death" when="1864-08-25">the 25th</date>.   <hi rend="italic">Post-mortem</hi> examination: The left
