                    and reported the result as follows: "Disorganization of tissue from a deep flesh
                    wound; hæmorrhage took place on June 10th, from the small vessels, and was
                    controlled by pressure, but recurred on <date type="operation" when="1864-06-15">June 15th</date>, when the femoral artery was
                    taken up at Scarpa's triangle. This vessel was again ligated, on <date type="operation" when="1864-06-18">June 18th</date>, at
                    Poupart's ligament; hæmorrhage again occurred on the morning of <date type="operation" when="1864-06-22">June 22d</date>, when the common iliac was
                    ligated. The patient died <date type="death" when="1864-06-22">during the day</date>." The report does not show which of the
                    two limbs was operated on, and diligent search has revealed no additional record
                    of the particulars of the case.  </p>
