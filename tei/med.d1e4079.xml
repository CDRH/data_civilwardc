                                        Diagnosis—typhoid fever. His health had been good
                                        until about <date type="injury" when="1861-10">a month before admission</date>, when he contracted
                                        intermittent fever. On the 3d his eyes were bright, cheeks
                                        flushed, pulse 100, quick and small, skin hot and dry,
                                        tongue faintly yellow; he had some appetite, some thirst,
                                        two stools and slight epigastric tenderness. On the 5th a
                                        blister was applied on account of increasing tenderness with
                                        some tympanites in the umbilical and iliac regions. At this
                                        time he was taking twelve grains of quinine daily with
                                        tincture of iron. On the 8th he was wakeful, the pulse rose
                                        to 120, the skin continued hot and the tongue coated; the
                                        tenderness had decreased, but the bowels were slightly
                                        relaxed and there was some cough. Emulsion of turpentine and
                                        beef-essence were prescribed. On the 10th there was much
                                        tympanites and three stools were passed. Whiskey-punch and
                                        astringents were ordered. On the 11th the eyes were bright,
                                        face pale, pulse 120 and quick, skin hot and dry, tongue dry
                                        and red but slightly yellow in the centre, appetite good.
                                        Acetate of lead and tannin were prescribed, but death took
                                        place on <date type="death" when="1861-11-17">the 17th</date>. </p>
