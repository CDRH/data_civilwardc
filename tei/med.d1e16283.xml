        Pennsylvania Cavalry</name>, aged 18 years, was wounded
        in an engagement at <name type="battle" key="113">Deep Bottom, Virginia</name>, <date type="injury" when="1864-08-14">August
          14th, 1864</date>, by a conoidal ball, which fractured
        and depressed the posterior portion of both tables
        of the right parietal bone. The ball, which was
        split from apex to centre, was found impacted on
        the edge of the fracture and was removed on the
        field.  He was admitted, on <date type="admit" when="1864-08-15">the following day</date>, to
        the hospital of the 2d division, Cavalry Corps,
        and thence conveyed to <name type="place" key="#Washington">Washington</name>, where he
        entered the <name type="hospital" key="172">Emory Hospital</name>, <date type="transfer" when="1864-08-17">August 17th</date>.  Cold
        water dressings were applied, the head kept cool
        by constant application of iced water, and low
        diet ordered.  On the morning of <date type="operation" when="1864-08-20">the 20th</date>, there
        were symptoms of compression; pulse 88, slow and
        soft. Chloroform was administered and <name type="person" key="1485">Surgeon N. R. Moseley</name>, <name type="organization" key="132">U. S. V.</name>, removed five small fragments
        of bone which had become detached, and elevated
        the depressed bone. The soft parts were quite
        extensively lacerated.  A strictly antiphlogistic
        course of treatment was established, and the
        patient remained comfortable until the evening of
        the 23d, when febrile symptoms of a severe
        character occurred; death supervened on <date type="death" when="1864-08-25">August
          25th, 1864</date>.  An autopsy showed extensive
        disorganization of the brain; the middle lobe of
        right hemisphere was in a suppurating condition,
        and the diseased action had extended as far back
        as the base of the brain.  The pathological
        specimen is shown in the wood-cut, and was
        contributed by the operator, <name type="person" key="1485">Surgeon N. R. Moseley</name>, <name type="organization" key="132">U. S. V.</name>  </p>
