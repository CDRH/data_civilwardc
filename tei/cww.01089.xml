            <div1 type="statement" subtype="handwritten">
                <p>The Claimant in this case, Mrs <persName>Ann H. Cunningham</persName>, by <persName>Wm. B. Webb</persName>, and <persName>Seaton Munroe</persName>, her attorneys, submits the following statement, in support of her claim herewith presented.</p>
                <p>As will be found on examination of the proceedings of the Commissioners, the said claimant has complied with all the provisions of the Act excepting one, to wit: the filing of the accompanying schedule within the time specified by the terms of the Act, which defect it is hoped may be cured by a brief statement of the attendant circumstances.</p>
                <p>The said Claimant is the widow of the late <persName>Captain Cunningham</persName> of the <placeName>United States</placeName> Navy, and has resided for several years, and still does reside in the <placeName>City of San Francisco California,</placeName> whither she accompanied her late husband when he was ordered to the command of the Navy Yard at that place. On her departure from <placeName>Washington</placeName>, she left resident therein her two slaves <persName>Ann</persName> and <persName>Anthony Blow</persName>, described in the schedule, who have since appeared before the Commissioners and been identified, and who were here resident at the time of the passage of the Emancipation Act.</p>
                <p>Immediately upon
                
            <pb xml:id="leaf004v" facs="cww.01089.004.jpg"/>    
                being advised of the passage of the said act, the said claimant communicated with her friends in this City, desiring information as to the proper course to be taken by her to secure the compensation for which the act provided. In response, the necessary blanks, with instructions were forwarded to her by mail at <placeName>San Francisco</placeName>, when she promptly executed the necessary instruments, and returned them by mail to her attorneys in this City This was subsequent to the time fixed by the Act for filing the schedule, but the claim was received and filed, and the schedule was received though not placed on file in due form.</p>
                <p>The said slaves were then taken before the Commissioners who appraised them, and before whom satisfactory evidence was given and placed upon record, as to the identity of the slaves, and as to the ownership and loyalty of the claimant. It is hoped and believed that the consideration of these explanatory circumstances may place the case upon the footing of a valid claim, as every effort was made through the ordinary channels of communication, that is to say the U. S. Mail, to have the requisite schedule executed and placed on file in the required <pb xml:id="leaf005r" facs="cww.01089.005.jpg"/> time. In view of these circumstances, the claimant is encouraged to hope that the Commissioners will, if this claim is not to be admitted within the strict provision of the Act which appropriated the sum for compensation, place it within the scope of such legislation as Congress may extend to cases of that nature.</p>
