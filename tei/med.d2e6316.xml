    <p><hi rend="initialcap">C</hi>ASE 307.&#8212;<name type="person" key="965">Private Charles Lackey</name>, <name type="organization" key="229">Co. E, 7th Wisconsin</name>, aged 30 years,
     was struck, at <name type="BATTLE" key="3"><choice><orig>Spottsylvania</orig><reg>Spotsylvania</reg></choice></name>, <date type="injury" when="1864-05-12">May 12, 1864</date>, by a conoidal musket ball,
     which entered in front at the upper part of the right thigh and produced a comminuted fracture of the femur through the trochanters, and extending downward nearly half the length of the shaft of the bone, and then lodged in the muscles at
     the posterior part of the thigh. After a fatiguing journey to <name type="place">Belle Plain</name>, to which most of the wounded from <name type="BATTLE" key="3"><choice><orig>Spottsylvania</orig><reg>Spotsylvania</reg></choice></name> were unavoidably subjected, <name type="person" key="965">Lackey</name> was conveyed on a hospital steamer to <name type="place" key="#Washington">Washington</name>, and was received at <name type="hospital" key="428">Judiciary Square Hospital</name> on <date type="admit" when="1864-05-18">May 18th</date>. The wounded limb was much swollen. The sharp extremity of the lower fragment of the femur had lacerated the muscles, and there was profuse suppuration with burrowing of pus throughout the thigh. The fracture was believed to extend into the joint. The patient earnestly demanded that an operation should be performed for his relief. His condition was unpromising, for he was suffering from surgical fever of an intense character. A consultation of surgeons decided, however, that, without operative interference, the case would prove inevitably and speedily fatal; and as the extensive fracture of the shaft of the femur and the purulent infiltration of the thigh precluded excision, amputation at the hip joint was determined on. On <date type="operation" when="1864-05-21">May 21st</date> an&#230;sthesia was induced by sulphuric ether, and <name type="person" key="905">Assistant Surgeon Alexander Ingram</name>, <name type="organization" key="190">U. S. A.</name>, performed the operation by the antero-posterior flap method. After the operation the patient reacted but partially. After removal to the ward he was plied with beef-tea and stimulants and restoratives; but he continued to sink, and died on the following day, <date type="death"
      when="1864-05-22">May 22, 1864</date>, twenty hours after the operation.&#178;</p>
   
   <p> &#178; The abstract of this case is compiled from register and Report of Surgical Operations of the <name type="hospital" key="428">Judiciary Square Hospital</name>, Washington. The case is noted at p. 50 of <hi rend="italic">Circular</hi> 6, S. G. O., 1865, as <hi rend="initialcap">C</hi>ASE 11. The age is correctly stated at &#34;19&#34; years, while in <hi rend="italic">Circular</hi> No. 7, S. G. O, 1867, pp. 37, 62, by a clerical inadvertence the age is given at &#34;30&#34; years.
