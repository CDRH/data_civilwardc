                            G, 5th Wisconsin Volunteers</name>, aged 23 years, was wounded at the battle of <name type="BATTLE" key="263">Cold Harbor, Virginia</name>, <date type="injury" when="1864-06-01">June 1st, 1864</date>, by a fragment of
                    shell, which grazed the top of the head, on the median line, about five and a
                    half inches from the margin of the hair on the forehead, inflicting a severe
                    wound of the scalp, about two inches in length by one inch in width, and
                    contusing the cranium. He was unconscious for about ten minutes, the control of
                    the lower extremities was lost, and sensation was impaired. Spasms and temporary
                    partial paralysis of the upper extremities supervened.  On <date type="admit" when="1864-06-06">June 6th</date>, he was admitted to <name type="hospital" key="186">First Division Hospital</name> at <name type="place" key="#Alexandria">Alexandria, Virginia</name>.  On <date type="transfer" when="1864-06-28">June 28th</date>, he was transferred to
                    <name type="hospital">McClellan Hospital, Philadelphia</name>, and thence, on <date type="transfer" when="1864-07-06">July 6th</date>, to <name type="hospital">Turner's Lane Hospital</name>. At the latter
                    date, the patient suffered from severe headache, and the power of motion of the
                    left leg was still impaired, though his general health was good.  On <date type="operation" when="1864-07-20">July 20th</date>, a small piece of bone
                    exfoliated, and was removed.  Patient was gradually regaining the use of left
                    leg. On November 15th, the wound was reported as being healed. During the
                    treatment, he had three paroxysms of intermittent fever. The patient was
                    transferred to the <name type="organization" key="109">Veteran Reserve
                        Corps</name> on <date type="duty" when="1865-03-17">March 17th,
                            1865</date>.  The case is reported by <name type="person" key="xx">Surgeon Robert A. Christian</name>, <name type="organization" key="132">U. S. V.</name>  He was discharged from service, <date type="servicedischarge" when="1865-09-26">September 26th, 1865</date>.  In <date type="pension" when="1866">1866</date>, <name type="person" key="430">Pension Examining Surgeon J. H. Gallagher</name>
                    reported that he had slight paralysis of the left leg, and headache and
                    faintness on exposure to the sun. Any excitement or study aggravated these
                    symptoms. The examiner regarded these symptoms as likely to increase in
                    severity. </p>
