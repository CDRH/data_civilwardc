                                        about 25; body completely covered with pits. About half an
                                        ounce of pus was found under the arachnoid on the left side,
                                        and this membrane appeared thick, white and opaque over the
                                        pons Varolii. The bronchial tubes and parenchyma of the
                                        posterior parts of the lungs were congested. The heart was
                                        firm and contained white fibrinous clots in all its
                                        cavities. The liver weighed ninety-four and a half ounces
                                        and was firm and mottled; the gall-bladder contained
                                        scarcely a drachm of dark bile; the spleen was flabby and
                                        light-colored. The stomach was slightly contracted; the
                                        duodenum congested and its mucous membrane thinned; the
                                        jejunum healthy; the valves of the ileum were thin and in
                                        some places nearly destroyed, its solitary follicles
                                        slightly enlarged and its agminated glands somewhat
                                        congested in the upper third; the large intestine was
                                        dilated. The kidneys weighed each eight and a half ounces
                                        and were dark and firm; the left contained a small
