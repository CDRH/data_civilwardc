      Goodell</name>, <name type="organization" key="159">Co. D, 25th Massachusetts</name>, aged 21
     years, was wounded at <name type="BATTLE" key="263">Cold Harbor</name>, <date type="injury" when="1864-06-03">June 3, 1864</date>. <name type="person" key="xx">Surgeon S. A.
      Richardson</name>, <name type="organization" key="338">13th New Hampshire</name>, recorded his
     admission to the Eighteenth Corps field hospital with "shot wound of right ankle." <name type="person" key="158">Surgeon R. B. Bontecou</name>, <name type="organization" key="132">U. S. V.</name>, reported the result of the injury as follows:
     "The patient entered the <name type="hospital" key="173">Harewood Hospital</name>, Washington,
      <date type="admit" when="1864-06-10">June 10th</date>, with shot wound of right foot near os
     calcis, the ball severing the tendo-achilles. On admission, he was very weak. The parts were swollen and suppurating freely, and
     became subsequently gangrenous, the tarsal and metatarsal bones denuded. An operation was
     deemed necessary, and performed on <date type="operation" when="1864-07-22">July 22d</date> by <name type="person" key="897">Acting Assistant
      Surgeon B. F. Butcher</name>, who amputated the leg at the lower third by the circular method.
     Sulphuric ether was used. The patient improved after the operation, and was furloughed <date type="furlough" when="1864-08-17">August 17th</date>, the stump looking well." The bones of
     the amputated ankle were contributed to the <name type="hospital" key="431">Museum</name> by
     the operator, and constitute specimen 3332 of the Surgical Section. In <date type="admit" when="1864-12">December following</date> the
     man was admitted to Dale Hospital, <name type="place">Worcester</name>, whence
      <name type="person" key="xx">Surgeon C. H. Chamberlain</name>, <name type="organization" key="132">U. S. V.</name>, reported that the stump assumed a large suppurating surface with
      several sinuses leading to diseased bone, and that on <date type="operation" when="1865-02-20">February 20, 1865</date>, he removed a
     sequestrum eight inches in length by a longitudinal incision. After this the patient was
     reported as having made excellent progress, and the stump as being nearly healed on March 31st.
     He was ultimately discharged from the Soldiers' Rest, at
     <name type="place">Boston</name>, <date type="hospitaldischarge" when="1863-10-31">October 31, 1863</date>, and pensioned. The
     pensioner was paid <date type="pension" when="1877-03-04">March 4, 1877</date>. </p>
