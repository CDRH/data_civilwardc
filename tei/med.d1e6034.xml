                                        examination: The brain was normal. The bronchial tubes on
                                        both sides presented indications of inflammation, and the
                                        lower lobes of the lungs contained hepatizations from the
                                        size of a chestnut to that of a hen's egg. The liver and
                                        spleen were large but unaltered in texture; the gall-bladder
                                        was small and half full of dark bile; the kidneys healthy;
                                        the pancreas enlarged and somewhat hardened. The mesenteric
                                        glands were enlarged and indurated; the mucous membrane of
                                        the stomach much injected; the duodenum and jejunum inflamed
                                        in patches; the ileum congested, thickened and softened, and
                                        its agminated glands ulcerated, the ulcers having thick,
                                        hard, prominent edges. The colon was inflamed in patches and
                                        its mucous membrane thickened.&#8212;<hi rend="italic"
