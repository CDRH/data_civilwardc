A, 10th New York</name>, wounded at <name type="BATTLE" key="127">Bull Run</name> on <date when="1862-08-28">August 28, 1862</date>, was sent to <name type="place" key="#washington">Washington</name>, and admitted into hospital on <date type="admit" when="1862-09-02">September 2nd</date>. <name type="person" key="xxx">Assistant Surgeon V. B. Hubbard</name>, <name type="organization" key="132">U. S. V.</name>, reported that a ball entered the pelvis at the left sacro-iliac synchondrosis and lodged. There ensued complete paralysis of the
    bladder,and no urine was voided save by the use of the catheter, which was retained in the bladder and gave issue to an intimate mixture of blood and urine in about equal proportions. The genitals were &#339;dematous; the tissues of the pelvis were infiltrated with urine, and escaped from the wound with the pus. The patient died on <date type="death" when="1862-09-19">September 19, 1862</date>.  The symptoms and termination of this case were very similar to those of <name type="person" key="xxx">Private Frank Smith</name>, who died five days previously from a similar wound.</p>
