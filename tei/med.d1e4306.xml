                                        Diagnosis&#8212;typhoid fever. In the evening the
                                        patient was weak and had no appetite; the pulse was 80; skin
                                        hot and moist; tongue coated white, but red at the tip and
                                        edges; one stool was passed; the right iliac region was
                                        tender, and complaint was made of pain in the back and legs.
                                        Ten grains of calomel and jalap were given. Eight dejections
                                        occurred during the night, and next morning the skin and
                                        eyes were jaundiced. Quinine was given. In the evening the
                                        pulse was 74, the skin warm and moist, the tongue coated
                                        gray but red at the tip, the bowels quiet; there was acute
                                        right iliac tenderness and mental <choice><orig>dulness</orig><reg>dullness</reg></choice> with tinnitus
                                        aurium. Next day the bowels remained quiet and the
                                        tenderness ceased; but pain in the head and in the back was
                                        noted. The abdominal tenderness returned on the 19th, when,
                                        also, the tongue was nearly clean but dry, the cheeks
                                        flushed and the pain in the back so acute as to require
                                        sinapisms. The bowels were quiet on the 20th and without
                                        pain or tympanites; the tongue coated gray; the skin moist.
                                        Two stools were passed on the 21st; the tongue was white,
                                        the skin hot and dry, and there was some thirst and cough,
                                        but the appetite was good. A few rose-spots appeared on the
                                        22d, the tongue being pale and moist, the pulse 80. In the
                                        evening of this day he was dull; pulse 61. He perspired
                                        during the night, and next day the skin was warm and moist,
                                        the tongue pale and clean and there was no tenderness,
                                        tympanites nor eruption. A few dark spots were found next
                                        day on the abdomen and chest. After this improvement was
                                        steady. The patient was walking about on the 29th and was
                                        transferred to <name type="place">Annapolis, Md.</name>, <date type="transfer"
