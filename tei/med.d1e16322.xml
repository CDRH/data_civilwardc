                                                  to the head, and sedatives were administered. In
                                                  the progress of the case, fragments of both the    
                                                  outer and inner tables were removed, leaving the
                                                  brain exposed.  The patient failed rapidly, and died apparently
                                                  from exhaustion on <date type="death" when="1864-08-30">August 30th, <choice><sic>1863</sic><reg>1864</reg></choice></date>.  At the autopsy, the scalp in the vicinity of the wound
                                                  was found to he infiltrated with pus, the
                                                  periosteum being easily detached. The fracture
                                                  involved both parietal bones, measuring one-half
                                                  by one inch, the longest diameter running at right
                                                  angles with the sagittal suture. Upon the removal
                                                  of the calvarium, the depressed portion of bone
                                                  was held in position by the dura mater. Through
                                                  both tables of the left parietal bone, from the
                                                  place of injury to the posterior inferior angle,
                                                  ran a fissure, along which traces of an attempt at
                                                  repair were observed. The meninges in the vicinity
                                                  were congested and thickened. In the left
                                                  hemisphere a cerebral abscess existed, extending
                                                  from the surface of the brain to a level with the
                                                  corpus callosum, three-fourths of an inch in
