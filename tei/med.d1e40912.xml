C., <name type="person" key="200">Assistant Surgeon William Thomson</name>, <name type="organization" key="190">U. S.

   <p><hi rend="initialcap">C</hi>ASE 314.—<name type="person" key="223">Private Abner H. Mundie</name>, <name type="organization" key="236">company G, 31st Maine volunteers</name>; admitted from the <name type="organization" key="377">army of the Potomac</name> <date type="admit" when="1864-09-09">September 9, 1864</date>.  Chronic diarrhœa and bronchitis.  [The register of the depot hospital of the 9th Corps, <name type="place">City Point, Virginia</name>, shows that this man was admitted to that hospital <date type="admit" when="1864-08-14">August 14th</date>—debility—and sent to general hospital <date type="transfer" when="1864-09-08">September 8th</date>.]  From the date of admission the patient was somewhat flighty, continually desiring to explain his disease. He was much emaciated and very weak. Vomiting occurred several times; it was sometimes brought on by a paroxysm of coughing. The abdomen was very flat, somewhat painful on pressure; the stools thin and frequent; the tongue moist; pulse very feeble and thready.  Died, <date type="death" when="1864-09-16">September 16th</date>.  <hi rend="italic">Autopsy:</hi> The lungs were much shrunken and engorged hypostatically; the ramifications of the bronchi were filled with a frothy fluid. The heart was firmly contracted and healthy. The liver was small and very green both superficially and deeply; the gall-bladder was full of very green bile. The spleen and kidneys were softened. The stomach contained three or four ounces of a dark-greenish fluid; its mucous membrane was softened. The small intestine was normal. The large intestine was thickened, and presented numerous follicular ulcers and some patches of pseudomembrane.—<name type="person" key="200">Assistant Surgeon William Thomson</name>, <name type="organization" key="190">U. S. A.</name>  [Nos. 393 and 394, Medical Section, <name type="hospital" key="431">Army Medical Museum</name>, are from this case. No. 393 is a portion of the ascending, No. 394 of the transverse, colon; both present numerous follicular ulcers, one of several lines in diameter. The mucous membrane is thickened, and presents, in No. 394, a number of small patches of adherent pseudomembrane.]</p>
