     when="1862-09">several days afterwards</date>, where the injury was noted but no treatment
    recorded. <name type="person" key="xx">Surgeon J. Hopkinson</name>, <name type="organization"
     key="132">U. S. V.</name>, in charge of <name type="hospital" key="xx">Mower Hospital,
     Philadelphia</name>, made the following record of the case: "The wound was caused by a ball,
    which entered the outer side of the tibia, fracturing the bone, and emerging on the inner side
    of the leg at the lower third. The tibia was resected at <name type="hospital" key="163"
     >Eckington Hospital</name>, from where the patient was transferred to this hospital <date
     type="transfer" when="1863-09-23">September 23, 1863</date>, the wound being nearly healed.
    Subsequent entries show that in addition to applications of water dressings to the wound the
    patient for a time received treatment for a syphilitic affection. He remained in <name
     type="hospital" key="xx">the hospital</name> until <date type="servicedischarge"
     when="1865-01-17">January 17, 1865</date>, when he was mustered out and pensioned. <name
     type="person" key="xx">Examining Surgeon D. W. Shindle</name>, of <name type="place" key="xx"
     >Sunbury, Pennsylvania</name>, certified to the fracture and excision, and added: "The wound
    healed, leaving the leg, however, very crooked, shortened, and necessarily much weakened, and
    rendering his locomotion unsteady, difficult, and at times painful, also liable to tire in
    standing as well as walking. General system much impaired." The pensioner died of phthisis
    pulmonalis, <date type="death" when="1870-10-20">October 20, 1870</date>, his attending
    physician testifying that the injury remained "a constant source of irritation until a short
    time previous to his death. Exfoliation of bone was frequent, resulting in nervous prostration, <choice>
     <orig>innutrition</orig>
     <reg>malnutrition</reg>
    </choice>, and impairment of his general health, a condition favorable to the development of
    tubercle. He never would undergo an operation for the removal of sequestra," etc. The specimen
