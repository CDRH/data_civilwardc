            <div1 type="petition" subtype="handwritten">
                <p>To the Commissioners under the act of Congress approved the <date
                        when="1862-04-16">16th of April, 1862</date>, entitled "an act for the
                    release of certain persons held to service or labor in the <placeName>District
                        of Columbia</placeName>."</p>

                <p>Your Petitioner <persName>Eliza B Mills</persName> of the <placeName>City of
                        Washington</placeName>, in said <placeName>District of Columbia</placeName>,
                    by this her petition in writing, represents and states, that she is a person
                    loyal to the <placeName>United States</placeName>, who, at the time of the
                    passage of the said act of Congress, held a claim to service or labor against a
                    certain person of African descent of the name of <persName>Eliza
                        Waters</persName> for and during the life of said <persName>Eliza
                        Waters</persName>, and that by said act of Congress said <persName>Eliza
                        Waters</persName> was discharged and freed of and from all claim of your
                    petitioner to such service or labor; that at the time of said discharge said
                        <persName>Eliza Waters</persName> was of the age of about sixty-two years,
                    and of the personal description following:&#8212;of color somewhat darker than
                    the ordinary mulatto color, with short hair, about the middle stature, and with
                    more activity of movement than is usual with persons of her age, but having no
                    distinctive marks about her. That your petitioner acquired her claim to the
                    aforesaid service or labor of said <persName>Eliza Waters</persName> in the
                    manner following; by purchase from Dr <persName>John McHenry</persName> of the
                        <placeName>City of Baltimore</placeName>, about forty-six years ago, for the
                    price of Three hundred dollars, She then being only about sixteen years of age,
                    and if there was any written bill of sale it has been long since lost or
                    mislaid, and that said purchase was made for your petitioner by the late
                        <persName>Robert Mills</persName>, her husband, who has since departed this
                    life. That your petitioner's claim to the service or labor <pb xml:id="leaf001v" facs="cww.00665.002.jpg"/> of said <persName>Eliza Waters</persName> was, at
                    the time of said discharge therefrom, of the value of Three hundred dollars in
                    money, which value arises from the fact that she is of indispensable use to your
                    petitioner, and is of general good health and with faculties less impaired than
                    is usual with persons of her age.</p>

                <p>Your petitioner hereby declares that she bears true and faithful allegiance to
                    the Government of the <placeName>United States</placeName>, and that she has not
                    borne arms against the <placeName>United States</placeName> in the present
                    rebellion, nor in any way given aid or comfort thereto.</p>

                <p>And your petitioner further states and alleges that she has not brought said
                        <persName>Eliza Waters</persName> into the <placeName>District of
                        Columbia</placeName> since the passage of said act of Congress; and that, at
                    the time of the passage thereof, said <persName>Eliza Waters</persName> was held
                    to service or labor therein under and by virtue of your petitioner's claim to
                    such service or labor.</p>

                <p>Your petitioner further states and alleges that <seg type="handwritten">her</seg> said claim to the service or labor of said <persName>Eliza
                        Waters</persName> does not originate in or by virtue of any transfer
                    heretofore made by any person who has in any manner aided or sustained the
                    present rebellion against the Government of the <placeName>United
                        States</placeName>.</p>

                <p>And your petitioner prays the said Commissioners to investigate and determine the
                    validity of her said claim to the service or labor of said <persName>Eliza
                        Waters</persName> herein above set forth; and if the same be found to be
                    valid, that they appraise and apportion the value of said claim in money, and
                    report the same to the Secretary of the Treasury of the <placeName>United
                        States</placeName>, in conformity <pb xml:id="leaf002r" facs="cww.00665.003.jpg"/>to the provisions of said act of Congress.</p>
