     the foot, at <name type="BATTLE" key="23">Fair Oaks</name>, <date type="injury" when="1862-05-31">May 31, 1862</date>, by a musket ball, which entered the outer side of the
     fifth metatarsal bone and made its exit at the first metatarsal just behind the great toe. He
     was admitted to <name type="hospital" key="428">Judiciary Square Hospital</name>, Washington,
     <date type="admit" when="1862-06-04">four days afterwards</date>, where the wound went on slowly for some days. The foot was probed and
     portions of the metatarsal bones were found to be bare and broken. There being no apparent
     natural effort to throw off the fragments, the upper wound was enlarged and one-half the second
     metatarsal bone, including the phalangeal articulation,
     was removed, together with considerable fragments of the third and fourth metatarsals. On the
     following day there was some pain, but no hæmorrhage.  On June 26th the patient was much
     better; foot a little red; poultices applied.  June 28th, severe chills; quinine administered.  June 29th and 30th, patient the same; foot inflamed a little.  July 1st, very severe chills and
     fever; skin and conjunctivas yellow; tongue brown, dry, and horny.  July 2d, bad symptoms
     increased.  July 3d, continuous vomiting; jaundice worse; tongue more moist.  July 4th, patient
     apparently a little better.  July 5th, foot improved, but general aspect bad.  Patient died <date type="death" when="1862-07-06">July 6, 1862</date>.  The history was contributed by <name type="person" key="1402">Acting Assistant Surgeon D. W. Cheever</name>, who also forwarded the
     removed portions of the metatarsal bones. (<hi rend="italic">Cat. Surg. Sect.</hi>, 1866, p.
