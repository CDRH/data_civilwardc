                                                  Maryland Cavalry</name>, aged 43 years, was wounded at

                                                  a conoidal ball, which entered the lumbar muscles
                                                  a little to the right of the spine, passed
                                                  forward, somewhat downward, and slightly inward,
                                                  exposing a portion of the body and transverse
                                                  process of the second lumbar vertebra. He was
                                                  admitted, on <date type="admit" when="1862-12-12">the next day</date>, to <name type="hospital" key="175">Stanton Hospital</name>,
                                                  Washington. There was complete paralysis of the
                                                  lower extremities, both as to sensation and motion; the urinary bladder was also paralyzed. His
                                                  general condition was favorable, and appetite
                                                  excellent. Simple dressings were applied to the
                                                  wound, and nourishing diet administered.
                                                  Catheterization was resorted to, twice daily.
                                                  During the month of January, 1863, he began to
                                                  recover the power of using his limbs in bed to
                                                  some extent. In February, the bladder had
                                                  recovered its tone so that it was only necessary
                                                  to use the catheter occasionally. During this
                                                  month, the paraplegia continued to diminish
                                                  slowly. The bullet came away in the dressings,
                                                  having gravitated down from its place of
                                                  lodgement, as the patient lay in bed. In March,
                                                  electricity was applied, and diuretics, tonics,
                                                  and purgatives administered. By April 6th, the
                                                  patient was able to sit up, and stand with a
                                                  little assistance. He had difficulty in the
                                                  retention of his urine upon assuming the erect
                                                  posture, which was probably occasioned by the
                                                  prolonged use of the catheter. The urine was also
                                                  scanty. On <date type="furlough" when="1863-08-15">August 15th</date>, he was furloughed. The
                                                  wound had healed and he was able to walk with the
                                                  aid of a crutch, April 4th: walks pretty well
                                                  with the aid of a cane. The wound reopens at
                                                  intervals, and after discharging awhile, closes
                                                  again. On <date type="transfer" when="1864-05-04">May 4th</date>, the patient was transferred to
