        <hi rend="initialcap">C</hi>ASE.—<name type="person">Private H.
        B——</name>, <name type="organization">27th Michigan Volunteers</name>, aged 21
        years, was wounded at <name type="BATTLE" key="250"><choice>
            <orig>Spottsylvania</orig>
            <reg>Spotsylvania</reg>
          </choice></name>, <date type="injury" when="1864-05-12">May 12th, 1864</date>, by a
        fragment of shell, which contused the upper anterior portion of the chest without lesion of
        the integument. He was admitted to <name type="hospital" key="214">Fairfax Seminary
          Hospital</name> on <date type="admit" when="1864-05-16">the 16th</date>; there was a large
        tumor at the point of injury and extensive suggillation. Cold-water dressings were applied,
        and extra diet allowed. On <date type="operation" when="1864-05-17">the 17th</date>, the
        tumor was evacuated by an incision, leaving a cavity some two inches in diameter. The
        patient did extremely well under the administration of quinia in small doses, and an extra
        diet, until <date type="injury" when="1864-06-15">June 15th</date>, when there was anorexia,
        dry tongue, an apparently healthy discharge from the wound, troublesome cough, and
        muco-purulent sputum. To combat these symptoms, tonics, stimulants, and an extra diet were
        directed. The patient sank gradually, and, by July 5th, complained of great pain in the
        lower part of the abdomen. There was also difficulty in micturition, which lasted five days.
        On the 10th, there was difficulty in speaking; great dyspnœa; respiratory murmur around
        the wound, and pulse varying from 100 to 110. This was followed by coma, and the patient
        died on <date type="death" when="1864-07-15">the 15th</date>. The autopsy revealed a
        fracture of the sternum—small pieces of the manubrium being driven in—with two
        apertures in the bone communicating with the lung. There was a large abscess in the left
        lung, with evidences of extensive pleuritis and effusion in the pleural cavities. The
        remaining organs exhibited nothing worthy of remark. The pathological specimen is carious
        within to a considerable extent, and, on the internal surface, is partly covered with a
        plate of new deposit. It was contributed to the <name type="hospital" key="431">Army Medical
          Museum</name> by <name type="person" key="245">Assistant Surgeon H. Allen</name>, <name type="organization" key="190">U. S. A.</name>, and is figured in the adjoining cut (<hi rend="initialcap">F</hi>IG. 227). </p>
