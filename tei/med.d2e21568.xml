     description of the injury: "A rifle ball penetrated the ankle, outer surface, fracturing the
     <choice><orig>astragalus</orig><reg>talus</reg></choice> and tibia. The man was admitted to <name type="hospital" key="173">Harewood Hospital</name>, Washington, <date type="transfer" when="1862-12-23">ten days after being wounded</date>. On <date type="operation" when="1862-12-27">December 27th</date> he was etherized, when the broken bones were removed from the tibia and <choice><orig>astragalus</orig><reg>talus</reg></choice>. During the
     progress of the case it became necessary to make several counter openings. Simple dressings
     were applied and stimulants and tonics were freely given for a considerable length of time. In
     May, 1863, the wound had entirely healed and the patient was gradually recovering the use of
     the ankle joint. On <date type="servicedischarge" when="1863-06-04">June 4, 1863</date>, he was
     discharged from service, having regained considerable motion of the joint." He subsequently
     became a pensioner and entered the <name type="place" key="xx">National Military Home
      in Ohio</name>, where he was examined at successive intervals by the <name type="organization" key="xx">Dayton Pension Board</name>, who certified to the ball having passed through the
     ankle, and described the foot and ankle as being in very good condition, but the joint as
     partially anchylosed and about one-half inch shortened. The pensioner was paid <date type="pension" when="1880-12-04">December 4, 1880</date>. </p>
