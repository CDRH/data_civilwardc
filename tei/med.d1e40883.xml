Diarrh&#339;a.  This man had yellow discharges from the bowels, which contained small lumps of undigested food, but no blood. His abdomen was slightly tender on pressure; pulse 80 and feeble; skin cool; perspiration profuse; tongue coated with a white fur in the centre, red on the tip and edges. He stated that he had frequently suffered from intermittent fever since he entered the army. He was treated at first with pills of tannic acid and opium, and subsequently with pills of persulphate of iron, extract of gentian and opium. These measures seemed to control the diarrh&#339;a somewhat, but on the 9th August he suddenly became delirious, his pupils dilated, his pulse very frequent; coma set in, and he died <date type="death" when="1863-08-10">August 10th</date>.  <hi rend="italic">Autopsy</hi> <date type="autopsy" when="1863-08-10">five hours after death</date>: The brain was examined with great care, but nothing abnormal was detected, except, perhaps, some slight congestion of the pia mater. The transverse colon was inflamed, but not ulcerated. The lungs, heart, liver, spleen, kidneys, and stomach appeared to be normal.&#8212;<name type="person" key="210">Acting Assistant Surgeon William H. Letterman</name>.</p>
