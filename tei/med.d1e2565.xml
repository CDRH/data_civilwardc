                                        the head, back and limbs; his face was slightly flushed and
                                        his eyes dull; pulse 96, full and strong; skin hot and soft;

                                        and edges; his appetite improved. His bowels were not

                                        colocynth, castor oil and sulphate of magnesia had to be

                                        his skin was of the normal temperature, tongue moist and
