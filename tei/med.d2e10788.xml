    the field hospital of the 3d division, Second Corps, with "shot fracture of thigh, followed by
    amputation." From the field the wounded man was transferred to the depot hospital at <name
     type="place">City Point</name>, and thence, on <date type="transfer" when="1864-10-08">October
     8th</date>, to <name type="place" key="#Washington">Washington</name>. <name type="person"

    with "antero-posterior flap amputation of the right thigh at the middle third," also that he was
    furloughed <date type="furlough" when="1864-12-09">December 9th</date>. The patient subsequently
    entered <name type="hospital" key="428">Judiciary Square Hospital</name>, and on <date
     type="servicedischarge" when="1865-05-06">May 6, 1865</date>, he was discharged from service,
    having been previously supplied with an artificial limb by the <name type="organization"
     key="450">Jewett Patent Leg Co.</name>, of <name type="place" key="#Washington">Washington, D.

    when he died of marasmus, his attending physician certifying that "it was evident that some
    portion of the splintered bone remained in the stump, as abscesses frequently formed thereon and
    copious discharges ensued;" also that the disease, as a consequence, first became apparent about
     <date type="injury" when="1871-04-01">the first of April, 1871</date>. The amputated portion of
    the femur, represented in the wood-cut (<hi rend="initialcap">F</hi>IG. 178), was contributed by
     <name type="person" key="1073">Surgeon D. S. Hays</name>, <name type="organization" key="141"
     >110th Pennsylvania</name>, who performed the operation. The specimen shows that the shaft was
    badly comminuted by a conoidal ball, which flattened, in a mushroom shape, against the anterior
    surface in the lowest third.</p>
