                        type="injury" when="1862-09-14">September 14th, 1862</date>, by a conoidal
                    ball, which entered the left side of the face at base of nose, passed backward,
                    and emerged from behind the right ear, separating the mastoid process of the
                    temporal bone. He became insensible. For several hours after return of
                    consciousness there was bleeding from mouth, ear, and eye.  On <date type="admit"
                        when="1862-09-29">September 29th</date>, he was admitted to the <name

                    Home Hospital, <name type="place">New York City</name>.  The portio dura and third pair of nerves were
                    paralyzed. There was loss of vision of right eye, and of sensation and mobility
                    of right side of face. The patient was unable to swallow or open his mouth.  Febrile action set in, which, together with pain in head and profuse suppuration
                    of wound, rapidly reduced the strength of the patient. He became pale, weak, and
                    emaciated; skin was moist, appetite poor; pulse regular, slow, and compressible;
                    the eye was lachrymose, and the mouth drawn to opposite side. The wound in the
                    face healed, but the posterior wound continued to discharge profusely.  He was
                    discharged on <date type="servicedischarge" when="1863-03-21">March 21st, 1863</date>,
