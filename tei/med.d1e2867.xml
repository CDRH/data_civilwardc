                                                1861</date>, with rheumatism. He improved rapidly
                                        till Sept. 6, when he was seized with a severe
                                        diarrh&#339;a, fever and pains in the head and bones.
                                        Sugar of lead, tannin and opium were prescribed. On the 11th
                                        tinnitus aurium, musc&#230; volitantes, slight deafness
                                        and headache were among the symptoms; the skin was hot and
                                        dry, pulse 116 and weak, tongue coated; seven stools were
                                        passed. On the 12th emulsion of turpentine was prescribed.
                                        On the 13th the tongue was dry and brown and the patient
                                        muttered in his sleep. He complained much of rheumatic pains
                                        in his bones; his bowels were moved five times during the
                                        night and nine times during the day. Beef-essence and brandy
                                        were given. He perspired much on the 15th, and the urine
                                        passed involuntarily. On the 16th he was very weak and had a
                                        cadaverous look; his tongue was dry, brown, glossy and red
                                        at the tip; the diarrh&#339;a continued. On the 17th he
                                        was much prostrated, somnolent and indifferent to
                                        surrounding objects, but the bladder was more under control
                                        and the stools less frequent. He had epistaxis during the
                                        night, and next day the tongue became moist and clean in
                                        patches and some rose-colored spots appeared on the abdomen.
                                        He was brighter on the 19th, free from delirium, but with
                                        some headache, dizziness and deafness; the tongue was clean,
                                        dry, glossy and protruded with difficulty. On the 20th the
                                        eyes were bright, face pale and sunken, pulse 90 and weak,
                                        skin warm and moist, tongue dry and brown but red at the tip
                                        and sides, teeth and lips clean; he had some appetite; one
                                        stool was passed and the iliac regions were tender. He
                                        continued in this condition, the bowels comparatively
                                        quiet,&#8212;occasional headache, dizziness and slight
                                        deafness being the only cerebral symptoms until October 8,
