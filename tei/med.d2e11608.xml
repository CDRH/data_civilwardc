     Dickey</name>, <name type="organization" key="442">Co. A, 4th Maine</name>, aged 21 years,
    received a gunshot wound of the right thigh, at <name type="BATTLE" key="48">Chantilly</name>,
     <date type="injury" when="1862-09-01">September 1, 1862</date>. He was taken to a field
    hospital in the vicinity of the battle ground, where the limb was amputated at the upper third,
    on <date type="operation" when="1862-09-05">the fourth day after the reception of the
     injury</date>. On <date type="transfer" when="1862-09-08">September 8th</date>, the patient
    arrived at <name type="place" key="#Washington">Washington</name> and was admitted to <name
     type="hospital" key="162">Douglas Hospital</name>. A h&#230;morrhage from the femoral artery,
    to the amount of twenty ounces, occurred on October 16th, and was controlled by pressure. After
    this the case progressed favorably and the wound healed about January 1, 1863. <date
     type="transfer" when="1863-03">About two months later</date> the patient was transferred to
     <name type="hospital" key="176">Lincoln Hospital</name>, and subsequently he was sent to <name
     type="hospital" key="160">St. Elizabeth Hospital</name>, whence he was discharged <date
     type="servicedischarge" when="1863-06-16">June 16, 1863</date>, and pensioned. <name
     type="person" key="1081">Mr. Dickey</name> was subsequently appointed a clerk at the <name
     type="organization" key="xxx">Pension Office</name>. On <date type="photo" when="1873-01-14"
     >January 14, 1873</date>, he visited the <name type="hospital" key="431">Army Medical
     Museum</name>, being in as good general health as he had been previous to the time of receiving
    the injury, and suffering no pain from the stump. He stated that his weight then was 194 pounds,
    while before he was wounded and lost his leg he only weighed 170 pounds. Owing to the shortness
    of the stump, being only three inches long from the hip joint, he is unable to wear an
    artificial limb and is obliged to use crutches in walking. A copy of the photograph, taken in
    1873, is represented in the wood-cut (<hi rend="initialcap">F</hi>IG. 188). His pension was paid
     <date type="pension" when="1879-09-04">September 4, 1879</date>. </p>
