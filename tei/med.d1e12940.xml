                and was taken to the field hospital of the 4th division of the Fifth Corps, and

                were not urgent, being limited to slight paralysis of the right upper extremity, and
                operative interference was deferred. On <date type="operation" when="1864-05-31">May
                    31st</date> a conoidal musket ball and several fragments of the left parietal

                compression of the brain were manifested. An exploration of the wound was made, and

                the autopsy the arachnoid was found little altered. There was an abscess in the
                posterior lobe of the left hemisphere, near the longitudinal sinus, of the size of a
                walnut, with walls of a greenish-yellow color, and communicating with the lateral

                </choice> fluid. There was a deposition of lymph at the base of the brain, extending
                from the medulla oblongata to the optic commissure. The specimen and facts connected
