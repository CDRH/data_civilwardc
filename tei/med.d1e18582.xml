                                                  which had been severed by a shell. Being knocked

                                                  hour or more, until awakened by the motion of the
                                                  ambulance that conveyed him to regimental
                                                  headquarters. On returning to consciousness, he
                                                  was unable to move the lower portion of his body.
                                                  Arriving at <name type="place">Patrick's Station</name>, he was cupped, and

                                                  the spinal region. He complained of pain in the
                                                  lower portion of the body. He was blistered, and
                                                  the blisters dressed with lint. He was sent to

                                                  admitted, he was in a semi-comatose condition;
                                                  complete paraplegia; sensation perfect. There was
                                                  some febrile action, and very severe diarrh&#339;a. He
                                                  passed his urine and f&#230;ces involuntarily;
                                                  appetite very good; pulse full and bounding;
                                                  emaciation slight. The temperature of the right
                                                  leg was slightly higher than that of the left, but
                                                  both were very cold; skin moist. The blistered
                                                  parts on each leg were suppurating slightly. The
                                                  parts in the region of the sacrum were in a
                                                  gangrenous condition. Opiates were given at night
                                                  and chlorides used to cleanse the
                                                  gangrenous wounds over the sacrum. Under the
                                                  administration of astringents the diarrh&#339;a ceased
                                                  by the 25th. The patient, however, continued to
                                                  sink, and died on <date type="death" when="1865-03-29">March 29th, 1865</date>. At the
                                                  autopsy, the first lumbar vertebra was found
                                                  transversely fractured entirely through its body
                                                  at its upper third, with each pedicle broken and
                                                  the left transverse and spinous processes
                                                  encroaching upon the cord, which was lacerated at
                                                  the lumbar and dorsal junction. The membranes were
                                                  torn entirely across, except a few fibres
                                                  anteriorly and posteriorly, and were congested
                                                  above and below the seat of injury. Clots of
                                                  diffused blood were found near the fracture. The
                                                  lower portion of the cord, severely lacerated, was
                                                  drawn up into a bundle at the seat of injury,
                                                  entirely deprived of the membranes. The
                                                  pathological specimens are Nos. 149 and 150,
                                                  Section I, A. M. M., and were contributed, with a
