      Ewing</name>, <name type="organization" key="230">Co. A, 140th Pennsylvania</name>, aged 30
     years, was wounded at the battle of <name type="BATTLE" key="3"><choice><orig>Spottsylvania</orig><reg>Spotsylvania</reg></choice></name>, on <date type="injury" when="1864-05-12">May 12, 1864</date>, by a conoidal musket
     ball, which comminuted the upper part of the left femur. He was taken to the hospital of the 1st division of the Second Corps, and on <date type="transfer" when="1864-05-13">the following day</date> was sent to the rear in a wagon. Arriving at <name type="place">Belle Plain</name> after a <date type="transfer" when="1864-05-16">three-days journey</date> over rough roads, he was conveyed on an hospital steamer to <name type="place" key="#Washington">Washington</name>, and, on <date type="transfer" when="1864-05-18">May 18th</date>, he was admitted to <name type="hospital" key="428">Judiciary Square Hospital</name>. There was considerable inflammation and swelling
     of the soft parts, and the patient was in poor health. On <date type="operation" when="1864-05-19">the following day</date> he was
     anæsthetized, and <name type="person" key="958">Acting Assistant Surgeon J. F.
      Thompson</name> made an incision five inches in length over the great trochanter, including in
     it the wound of entrance. The muscular attachments being divided, it was found that the neck
     was splintered, that fissures extended within the capsule, that the great trochanter was
     separated from the shaft, and the upper part of the shaft much comminuted. The head and
     fragments of the neck and trochanters were removed, and the shaft was sawn just below the
     trochanter minor. Ice was applied to the wound, and stimulants were freely administered. The
     wound assumed an unhealthy action, and the patient gradually sank and died from exhaustion on
      <date type="death" when="1864-05-24">May 24, 1864</date>, five days after the operation. The
     pathological specimen was not received at the <name type="hospital" key="431">Army Medical
      Museum</name>. </p>
