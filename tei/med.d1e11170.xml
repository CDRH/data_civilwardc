                                        portion of the cerebrum was intensely red; the ventricles
                                        contained half a drachm of bloody liquid. The trachea was
                                        filled with frothy secretion, congested purplish in its
                                        lower portion and at its bifurcation enlarged and softened.
                                        The mucous membrane of the epiglottis and upper half of the
                                        larynx was purple; in the lower half it was pale. The right
                                        lung, thirty-one ounces, was slightly congested,
                                        intermingled with dark spots, but its base was hepatized red
                                        and the centre of its third lobe was grayish, solid and
                                        heavier than water. The lower portion of the first lobe of
                                        the left lung was covered with a layer of recent lymph and
                                        its substance was hepatized gray; the second lobe was dark-blue externally and on section reddish-purple and solidified
                                        in nodular masses; the lung weighed thirty-four ounces. The
                                        heart contained mixed clots and the pericardium eleven
                                        drachms of fluid. The liver and pancreas were healthy; the
                                        spleen large and soft. The mucous membrane of the stomach
                                        was parti-colored with a deep purplish patch in the centre.
                                        Peyer's patches and the solitary glands in the large as well
                                        as the small intestine were congested, but neither ulcerated
                                        nor elevated. The kidneys were much congested and firm,
                                        their pelves pale but with numerous injected points.&#8212;<hi rend="italic"><name type="person" key="245">Ass't Surgeon Harrison Allen</name>, <name type="organization" key="190">U.
