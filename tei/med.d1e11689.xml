                                been affected <date type="injury" when="1864-02">for six weeks</date> with synovitis of the right
                                        knee, the cause of which was unknown. Tincture of iodine was
                                        applied daily. On <date type="injury" when="1864-04-03">April 3</date> he had a violent headache, with
                                pain in the back and bowels, some vomiting and diarrhœa,
                                        complete anorexia, and jaundiced eyes and skin. Camphor
                                        and opium pills were given, with hop fomentations to the
                                        abdomen. Next day drowsiness and fever were added to the
                                        symptoms; the pain in the abdomen was aggravated, the pulse
                                        small and frequent. During the night of the 4th he had
                                        fourteen stools and vomited a greenish liquid once or twice.
                                        At 5 A. M. of the 5th the pulse was 140, very
                                        small, weak and soft, respiration 42, expression anxious.
                                        The pain in the abdomen continued; the vomiting,
                                        temporarily checked by creasote and morphine, recurred at
                                        times with increasing prostration until death occurred, on
                                        the morning of <date type="death" when="1864-04-06">the 6th</date>.  <hi rend="italic">Post-mortem</hi> examination: Body not
                                emaciated; skin tawny; conjunctivæ yellow; mouth and
                                        nostrils giving issue to a yellow liquid. The knee-joint
                                        contained about two ounces of synovia and a few flakes of
                                        lymph; the membrane lining the cartilages of the patella and
                                        femur was roughened; the subserous areolar tissue on the
                                        ligamentum patellae and other soft parts of the joint was
                                        exceedingly vascular. The abdomen was distended with several
                                        quarts of serum and lymph,—there was a large
                                        quantity of lymph in the pelvis and also above the liver,
                                        and the intestines were glued together, but no perforation
                                        or other indication of the origin of the peritonitis was
                                        discovered. The stomach and intestines were distended with
                                        liquid. The liver was fatty; part of the right and left lobes
                                        was hob-nailed, showing on section a surface mottled with
                                        red, yellow and gray, and knotty to the touch. Heart and
