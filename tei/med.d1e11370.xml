                                age 21; was admitted <date type="admit" when="1864-06-15">June 15, 1864</date>, with enteritis consecutive to measles.  On the 29th the abdomen was tender,
                                        the bowels loose and the chest painful on the right side;
                                        there was much thirst and the tongue was furred and brown.  On July 4 the bowels were less irritable and the cough
                                        slight, notwithstanding some dyspnœa.  On the morning of <date type="death" when="1864-07-07">the 7th</date> delirium was present but subsided by 11 A. M. At 2.30 P. M. his limbs became suddenly drawn up, his head bent on his shoulders, eyes open and glaring, face turgid and the veins
                                        everywhere much engorged. Death followed almost instantly.   <hi rend="italic">Post-mortem</hi> examination: The cerebrum was softened and its
                                        vessels somewhat injected. The lower lobe of the right lung
                                        was much congested, the middle lobe healthy, the upper lobe
                                        hepatized red posteriorly and gray anteriorly; the lower
                                        lobe of the left lung was hepatized gray in its posterior
                                        and lower part and elsewhere thoroughly engorged, the upper
                                        lobe congested posteriorly; the bronchial mucous membrane
                                        was much inflamed; the right lung weighed twenty-eight and a
                                        half ounces, the left twenty-five ounces. The pericardium
                                        contained four ounces of liquid; the heart was flabby; its
                                        right ventricle contained a large fibrinous clot extending
                                        into the pulmonary artery and its left ventricle a smaller
                                        but similar clot. The liver was flabby; the spleen, ten
                                        ounces, was soft and pulpy; the solitary follicles were
                                        enlarged, and a Peyer's patch just above the ileocæcal
                                        valve was somewhat thickened.—<hi rend="italic"><name type="hospital" key="176">Lincoln Hospital</name>, Washington, D. C.</hi> </p>
