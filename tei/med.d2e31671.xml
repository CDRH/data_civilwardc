On admission, the patient had high fever and great abdominal tenderness. He was ordered to have flaxseed cataplasms over the abdomen, to take calomel and opium, and low diet. This treatment was continued until July 2d, when the calomel was omitted and the opiate continued.  On July 4th, the ball was passed by the anus, about 4 A. M., without any inconvenience to the patient."  After this, he improved without any adverse symptoms, except, at times, a slight diarrhœa, which yielded to appropriate treatment.
