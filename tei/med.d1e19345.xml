A conoidal musket ball had
        entered the back on the left side, about three inches from the point of the acromion
        process, penetrated the spine of the scapula just below the crest, passed inward and
        forward, and fractured the clavicle at the point where the conoid ligament is attached. From
        this point, its course was traced behind the large blood vessels of the neck and between the
        œsophagus and spinal column. Here an abscess was formed which reached upward five or
        six inches along the spine and downward in the mediastinum to the bifurcation of the
        trachea, where the ball was found point downward and resting against the right bronchial
        tube. An opening was found communicating with the abscess and the right pleural cavity. The
        track of the ball and the large abscess were filled with pus, and clots of blood undergoing
        putrefaction. Portions of the left scapula and clavicle were contributed to the <name type="hospital" key="431">Army Medical Museum</name>, with the above account, by <name type="person" key="102">Surgeon O. A.
