      Romaine</name>, <name type="organization" key="561">Co. I, 145th New York</name>, aged 20
     years, was wounded in the right index finger <date type="injury" when="1862-10-25">October 25,
      1862</date>. The finger was amputated near the base of the first phalanx on <date type="operation" when="1862-10-30">October 30th</date>. The
     part healed readily, but was very tender and often painful. In this condition he was admitted
     into <name type="hospital" key="176">Lincoln Hospital</name>, Washington, <date type="admit"
      when="1863-01-18">January 18, 1863</date>.  <name type="person" key="1506">Acting Assistant
      Surgeon B. P. Brown</name> reported: "Nothing special transpired until March 20th, when, on
     attempting to swallow, he was seized with pain and stiffness in the neck and was unable to speak. Soon
     there was a heaving up of the chest and the head was rapidly thrown from side to side; the jaws
     closed, the angles of the mouth were drawn back, the eyebrows knit, and the countenance of a
     ghastly appearance. For a moment there would be partial remission, when the patient would
     complain that he could not bear to have any one touch him, as it caused the most severe
     suffering. Suddenly another paroxysm would come on more severe than the former, and then an
     interval, which, however, would be very short. This state of things continued from four o'clock
     P. M. till <date type="operation" when="1862-03-21">one o'clock A. M.</date>, when it was decided upon to open the wound and search for the
     cause. The part being laid open, a neuroma somewhat larger than a buckshot was found intimately
     incorporated with the hard cicatrix and tightly adherent to a <choice><orig>spiculum</orig><reg>spicula</reg></choice> of bone beneath. The
     tumor was removed, also the bony portion to which it had been attached. The parts were then
     brought together by adhesive straps, and the patient rested well, having but one more spasm
     about four o'clock A. M., and that very light. He is now quite recovered and enjoying better
     health than for some months past."  He was discharged from service <date type="servicedischarge"
      when="1863-06-19">June 19, 1863</date>. He is not a pensioner.</p>
