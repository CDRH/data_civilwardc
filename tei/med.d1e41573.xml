Chronic diarrhœa.  The patient, who was of a scrofulous constitution, had suffered from diarrhœa for four months, and was much exhausted. A dose of castor oil and laudanum was administered immediately after he entered hospital; subsequently he took pills of tannic acid and opium. Under this treatment the number of stools was speedily reduced to one daily; nevertheless he rapidly sank, and died comatose, <date type="death" when="1864-03-30">March 30th</date>.  <hi rend="italic">Autopsy:</hi> Both lungs contained tubercles, which were especially abundant in the upper lobe of the right lung; this lobe was also the seat of an abscess containing about an ounce of fluid. The stomach and small intestine were healthy. The mucous membrane of the colon was thickened, softened, and ulcerated. The spleen contained numerous tubercles.—<name type="person" key="134">Surgeon E. Bentley</name>, <name type="organization" key="132">U. S. V.</name>   [Nos. 296 to 298, Medical Section, <name type="hospital" key="431">Army Medical Museum</name>, are from this case.  No. 296 is a portion of the ascending colon near the cæcum; No. 297 a portion of the right extremity of the transverse colon; in both the mucous membrane is considerably thickened, and presents follicular ulcers, which are most numerous in No. 296.  No. 298 is the spleen, with a number of small tubercles just beneath its peritoneum.]</p>
