K, 8th New Jersey</name>, aged 22 years, received a gunshot wound of the abdomen at <name type="BATTLE" key="10">Chancellorsville</name>, <date type="injury" when="1863-05-03">May 3, 1863</date>.

Treatment: anodynes to relieve pain and keep the bowels quiet; spirit lotion to the wound; mucilage and essence of beef.  May 11th, seven o'clock A. M., for the last hour has been distressed with a hippocratic expression; pale; skin moist and cool; slight hiccough; has had a stool, and passed some f&#230;ces and offensive decomposed blood. Hoffman's anodyne and tincture of opium were given to relieve the pain.  May 12th, has slept well, and, at six o'clock A. M., had a muco-purulent, sanious, and offensive alvine evacuation, with pain, which was relieved by injections of mucilage and opium.  May 13th, slept well; no movement of bowels; was comfortable until five o'clock P. M., and then became restless and languid. Hoffman's anodyne, opium, and calomel were administered, with an injection of opium.  May 14th, slept well; pulse 108; tongue coated, and appetite poor; abdomen full; wound one and a half inches in diameter and gangrenous; toward evening, became uneasy and vomited up everything; turpentine was applied to the abdomen, and wine or whiskey administered.  On the 15th he was much the same, vomiting everything; pulse 100, and tongue coated yellowish; toward evening, he became restless, and the pulse rose to 132; he vomited everything he swallowed.  May 16th, at two o'clock A. M., he was apparently dying, but perfectly sensible; was relieved by anodynes. He died at five o'clock A. M., <date type="death" when="1863-05-16">May 16th</date>.  Autopsy, five hours after death:  Some <choice><orig>fulness</orig><reg>fullness</reg></choice>, centering at the wound; slight <choice><sic>tympanitis</sic><corr>tympanites</corr></choice>. Section showed extensive peritoneal inflammation; abdominal walls and contents agglutinated, except where there was decomposition. One large sinus was filled with pus and decomposed blood; another with gas, mostly in the bowels; and another with a pale gruel-like mixture, as though made from coarse meal.  The ball passed in horizontally, perforating the sigmoid flexure of the colon, but was not found; careful search was not made, as there was great stench and decomposition and the friends were waiting for the body."</p>
