                                        the left lung was congested posteriorly. The pericardium
                                        contained two ounces of liquid; the right cavities of the
                                        heart were filled with a large partially washed clot. The
                                        liver was enlarged and pale; the gall-bladder distended with
                                        viscid bile; the spleen enlarged and soft. The stomach was
                                        inflated with gas, dilated and flabby, and its mucous
                                        membrane was reddened near the pylorus. In the lower half of
                                        the ileum the agminated glands were congested, enlarged and
                                        prominent, and those near the ileo-c&#230;cal valve
                                        showed small ulcers; the mucous membrane around the glands
                                        was more or less congested according to its proximity or
                                        distance from the valve; the solitary follicles were
                                        enlarged and prominent. No ulcers were found in the large
                                        intestine, which, however, was congested throughout and
                                        dotted with black pigment, particularly in the descending
                                        colon, where an occasional large black spot appeared.  [<hi
