                    obliquely about the middle of the forehead.  He was admitted to the hospital of
                    the 2d division, Sixth Corps, but the injury must have been considered slight,
                    as no record of the case was found until <date type="admit" when="1864-07-12">July 12th</date>, when the patient was admitted to <name type="hospital"
                        key="165">Mount Pleasant Hospital</name>, on account of a gunshot scalp
                    wound near the occipital protuberance, subsequently received in <name type="person" key="xxx">General Early</name>'s
                    demonstration against the defences of <name type="place" key="WASHINGTON">Washington</name>, the day of the patient's
                    admission.  Gangrene attacked this later wound. Bromine, nitric acid, yeast, and
                    charcoal poultices were successively applied to the gangrenous wound. The
                    sloughing was checked, and the wound soon assumed a healthy appearance. The
                    wound on the forehead was not affected by gangrene, and was supposed to be
                    trifling, and was treated with simple dressings.  <date type="injury" when="1864-08-06">A month after</date> his admission,
                    the man complained of some pain in the forehead. Ice water was applied, and
                    morphia was given internally.  Death occurred <date type="death" when="1864-08-06">a few hours afterwards</date>.  On August
                    7th, 1864, at the <hi rend="italic">post mortem</hi> examination, the brain was
                    found to be slightly congested, but no pus was observed between the skull and
                    dura mater; yet the latter was detached from the inner table of the skull, which
                    was carious over a surface nearly as large as the surface of the incipient
                    exfoliation on the outer table. The scale of dead bone of the outer table
                    remained <choice><orig>in siter</orig><reg>in situ</reg></choice>. The dura mater opposite the diseased inner table was
                    thickened and had deposits of lymph on the surface next the cranium; otherwise,
                    the encephalon was normal in appearance.  The specimen was contributed by <name
