                                        fever. He slept well, but his eyes were suffused and he had
                                        some pain in the head, anorexia and slightly relaxed bowels;
                                        his tongue was moist and coated yellowish in the centre;
                                        skin natural; pulse 90 and full. Rose-colored spots appeared
                                        on the chest and abdomen on the 5th and were very profuse on
                                        the 7th, when the skin became hot and dry, the lips parched
                                        and the tongue red and glossy at the tip and edges and dry
                                        at the base and centre; five stools were passed on this day,
                                        and there was much tympanites but no tenderness. By the 10th
                                        the eyes had become injected, the cheeks flushed, the tongue
                                        dry and dark and the teeth covered with sordes; the patient
                                        was stupid and at times delirious; meteorism and borborygmus
                                        accompanied the diarrh&#339;a. Up to this time emulsion

                                        hour. The bowels were moved nine times on the 11th and the
                                        right iliac region was markedly tender. Tincture of iron was
                                        given on the 12th. Deafness was noticeable on <date type="injury" when="1861-10-13">the 13th</date>. This

                                        patient was troubled with some cough during this period. The
                                        skin was reported moist for the first time on the 24th. The
                                        eruption did not disappear until the 28th. The tongue
                                        continued moist and but slightly coated, the skin natural,
