Great emaciation. The brain was not examined. The heart and lungs were free from disease. The omentum was a mere sheet of thin membrane with no fat anywhere. The extremity of the vermiform appendix was adherent to the peritoneum just under the umbilicus; there were also adhesions in the vicinity of the caput coli. The sigmoid flexure of the colon was found in the left hypochondriac region. The left kidney was found reposing directly upon the promontory of the sacrum, and its hilum was found upon its upper anterior surface; the renal arteries supplying it came off from the bifurcation of the aorta, and consisted of four branches. The spermatic arteries also were lower down than usual, arising about an inch above the bifurcation of the aorta. The right kidney was normal in size and position. The spleen was very small and corrugated. The liver healthy, but small. The whole extent of the mucous lining of the intestine was soft and thin. In the c&#230;cum and ascending colon there were numerous nearly circular patches of ulceration, and a deposit of pseudomembrane.&#8212;<name type="person" key="xxx">Acting Assistant Surgeon W. B.
