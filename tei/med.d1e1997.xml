            1861</date>. Diagnosis&#8212;typhoid fever. Ten days before admission he had chills,
          followed by fever, increasing debility, pain in the head and bones, anorexia and slight
          diarrh&#339;a. He rested well after a bath and Dover's powder, and on the 15th the
          pulse was 88, tongue moist, red at the tip and sides, brown in centre, bowels regular,
          skin dry and warm. In the evening he was drowsy and had a sense of heaviness over the
          eyes; the bowels were quiet. Sulphate of magnesia was given with the effect of moving the
          bowels twice. After this the bowels remained quiet, but with some tenderness and gurgling
          in the right iliac region. The tongue became somewhat dry on the 18th, but regained its
          moisture in a few hours. The skin became moist on the 20th, the appetite returned, and the
          sense of heaviness in the head was removed. On the 22d turpentine emulsion and one ounce
          of brandy were ordered for administration every three hours. He rested poorly on the 24th
          and had some nausea and less appetite. Castor oil was administered, and repeated on the
          26th and on the 29th, after which one drachm of extract of senna was given daily for some
          days on account of headache and dizziness. He was able to sit up on the 27th, and was
          transferred to <name type="place">Annapolis, Md.</name>, on <date type="transfer" when="1861-10-10">October
            10th</date>. No rose-colored spots were observed in the case. </p>
