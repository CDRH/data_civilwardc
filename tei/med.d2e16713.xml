      Stanley</name>, <name type="organization" key="367">Co. H, 53d Pennsylvania</name>, aged 26
     years, was wounded at <name type="BATTLE" key="4">Fredericksburg</name>, <date type="injury"
      when="1862-12-13">December 13, 1862</date>. He was admitted to a Second Corps field hospital, and thence transferred to <name type="place" key="#Washington">Washington</name>. <name
      type="person" key="457">Assistant Surgeon C. C. Lee</name>, <name type="organization"
      key="190">U. S. A.</name>, reported: "The patient entered <name type="hospital" key="162">Douglas Hospital</name>
     <date type="admit" when="1862-12-26">December 26th</date>, having received a comminuted
     fracture of the upper third of the right leg, for which amputation through the knee joint was
     performed <date type="operation" when="1862-12-27">the following day</date>. He stated that h&#230;morrhage was profuse both before and since
     the amputation. The stump sloughed somewhat and did badly. On March 1, 1863, when I took charge
     of the case, the stump was tightly bandaged from above downward, the extremities being swollen
     and bulbous, and the thigh completely honeycombed in appearance by small abscesses and sinuses
     for six inches above the condyles. The bandage was removed and the sinuses and abscesses laid
     open. The patient was also greatly enfeebled by chronic diarrh&#339;a, from which he had
     suffered for six months, and which, though checked from time to time, always returned with full
     force. In this state he vacillated from better to worse until April 20th, when, without any
     ostensible cause, he was seized with obstinate nausea and vomiting. This resisted every means
     employed to remedy it and exhausted what little strength remained in the patient. He sank
     steadily until the night of <date type="death" when="1863-04-26">April 26, 1863</date>, when he
     expired of sheer debility. At the autopsy, the thoracic viscera were found healthy with the
     exception of old pleuritic adhesions on the right side; lungs crepitant throughout and without
     tubercular deposit. The liver and kidneys were shrunken and showed evidence of chronic
     congestion, but were otherwise normal; stomach and spleen healthy. In the large intestines
     well-marked congestion was observed and partial maceration of the mucous membrane, which was
     here and there dotted with dark macul&#230;. These spots were surrounded by depressions and
     apparent cicatrices in the mucous membranes, and were thought to be the result of ulcers that
     had already cicatrized. The condition described was chiefly noticed in the upper portion of the
     rectum. The small intestines were here and there greatly congested, but no ulceration was
     detected. The stump had healed completely; but from the removal of the patella in the operation and the subsequent emaciation of the patient the edges of the condyles were too
     superficial to have borne pressure with success. A large abscess, which had been very
     troublesome during life, existed between the rectus and crur&#230;us muscles. The latter was
     wasted to the last degree, but seemed to have protected the bone, which was not diseased. A
     very complete calcareous degeneration of the mesenteric glands should also have been noted above." The lowest
     portion of the femur was saved and contributed to <name type="hospital" key="431">the Museum</name> by <name type="person" key="200">Assistant Surgeon W. Thomson</name>, <name
