                <p>To the Commissioners under the Act of Congress approved the <date when="1862-04-16">16th of April 1862</date>, entitled "An act for the
                    release of certain persons held to service or labor in the <placeName>District
                        of Columbia</placeName>.</p>

                <p>Your Petitioner <persName>William S Johnston</persName> of <placeName>Fairfax
                        County</placeName>, 
                    <placeName>Virginia</placeName>, by this his petition in writing, represents and
                    states that he is a person loyal to the <placeName>United States</placeName>,
                    who, at the time of the passage of the said act of Congress, held a claim to
                    service or labor against a person of African descent of the name of
                        <persName>George Carmichael</persName> for and during the life of said
                        <persName>George Carmichael</persName>, and that by said Act of Congress
                    said <persName>George Carmichael</persName> is discharged and freed of and from
                    all claim of your petitioner to such service or labor; that at the time of said
                    discharge said <persName>George Carmichael</persName> was of the age of thirty
                    eight years, stout and very black and about five feet ten inches in height: That
                    your petitioner acquired his claim to the aforesaid service or labor of said
                        <persName>George Carmichael</persName> by the death of his father
                        <persName>Dennis Johnston</persName>.</p>


                <p>That your petitioners claim to the service or labor of the said <persName>George
                        Carmichael</persName> was, at the time of said discharge therefrom, of the
                    value of Fifteen hundred dollars in money</p>

                <p>Your petitioner hereby declares that he bears true and faithful allegiance to the
                    government of the <placeName>United States</placeName>, and that he has not
                    borne arms against the <placeName>United States</placeName> in the present
                    rebellion, nor in any way given aid or comfort thereto.</p>

                <p>And your petitioner further states and alleges that he has not brought said
                        <persName>George Carmichael</persName> into the <placeName>District of
                        Columbia</placeName> since the passage of said act of Congress; and that at
                    the time of the passage thereof said <persName>George Carmichael</persName> was
                    held to service or <choice>

                        <corr>labor</corr>
                    </choice> therein under and by virtue of your petitioner's claim to such service
                    or labor.</p>

                <p>Your petitioner further states and alleges that his said claim to the service or
                    labor of said <persName>George Carmichael</persName> does not originate in
                    or by virtue of any transfer heretofore made by any person who has in any manner
                    aided or sustained the present rebellion against the Government of the
                        <placeName>United States</placeName>.</p>

                <p>And your petitioner prays the said Commissioners to investigate and determine the
                    validity of his said claim to the service or labor of the said <persName>George
                        Carmichael</persName> herein above set forth; and if the same be found to be
                    valid, that they appraise and apportion the value of said claim in money, and
                    report the same to the Secretary of the Treasury of the <placeName>United
                        States</placeName>, in conformity to the provisions of said act of
                    Congress.</p>
