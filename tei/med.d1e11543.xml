                                age 20; was admitted <date type="admit" when="1864-10-05">Oct. 5, 1864</date>, with organic disease of
                                        the heart. His comrades reported that he had a short time
                                        before suffered from an attack of articular rheumatism.
                                        He was an&#230;mic and had anasarca, dyspn&#339;a and a rapid and
                                        tumultuous action of the heart unaccompanied by any decided
                                        bellows murmur; his pulse was rapid and irregular; tongue
                                        covered with a thin gray coat; face turgid and expression
                                        anxious; he preferred the sitting posture. The symptoms
                                        became aggravated, the heart's action more tumultuous and
                                        irregular and the dyspn&#339;a greatly increased; he complained
                                        of imperfect vision and roaring sounds in his ears.  He died
                                        on <date type="death" when="1864-10-07">the 7th</date>.   <hi rend="italic">Post-mortem</hi> examination: There were adhesions
                                        and a small quantity of liquid in the right pleura; both lungs were congested. The
                                        pericardium contained two ounces of liquid; the heart was
                                        greatly dilated, but there was no marked thickening of its
                                        walls; the right side and the great veins were filled with
                                        venous blood; the left side contained dark blood with large
                                        flakes of lymph entangled among the muscular columns;
                                        small, firm, wart-like excrescences were found on the mitral
                                        valve and large ones on the aortic valves,&#8212;[<hi rend="italic">Specimen</hi> 472, Med. Sec., <name type="hospital" key="431">Army Medical Museum</name>]; the endocardium was red and injected. The liver presented a fine
                                        nutmeg appearance; the gall-bladder was nearly filled with
                                        viscid bile; the spleen was healthy, although bound down in
                                        the left hypochondrium by recent adhesions. The kidneys,
