   <p>The notes of the next case were forwarded, with the specimen, from the <name type="hospital" key="xxx"><hi rend="initialcap">R</hi>EGIMENTAL <hi rend="initialcap">H</hi>OSPITAL of the 8th Illinois cavalry</name>, Washington, D.

   <p><hi rend="initialcap">C</hi>ASE 436.&#8212;<name type="person" key="xxx">Private Frederick Gewecke</name>, <name type="organization" key="xxx">company K, 8th Illinois cavalry</name>; German; age 27; admitted to regimental hospital <date type="admit" when="1864-05-06">May 6, 1864</date>. He had been under treatment in quarters for some time with diarrh&#339;a alternating with constipation. His breath was very offensive, resembling emanations from putrid animal matter. Obstinate diarrh&#339;a soon supervened, with fever of an adynamic type. This state continued, with anorexia and emaciation, until May 18th, when he had h&#230;morrhage of the bowels. The turpentine he was taking was then increased in quantity, and the h&#230;morrhage was checked by enemata of solution of the persulphate of iron and laudanum. It recurred, however, several times, and he died <date type="death" when="1864-05-23">May 23d</date>. <hi rend="italic">Autopsy:</hi> The lungs, liver, spleen and kidneys were apparently healthy. The mucous membrane of the small intestine was softened and ulcerated in patches. The colon from the c&#230;cum to the rectum was ragged with ulceration; there were more than twenty perforations, yet no f&#230;cal matter had escaped into the peritoneal cavity, and there were few adhesions showing peritoneal inflammation.  [No. 322, Medical Section, <name type="hospital" key="431">Army Medical Museum</name>, is from this case.  The specimen is a portion of the thickened ascending colon, presenting a number of deep ulcers with ragged edges. Two of the ulcers have perforated.]</p>
