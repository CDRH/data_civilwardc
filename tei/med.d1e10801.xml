The larynx and
                                        trachea were lined throughout by false membrane, which
                                        covered both surfaces of the epiglottis; the underlying
                                        mucous membrane was of an intense purplish-red color.  [<hi rend="italic">Specimen</hi> 10, Med. Sec., <name type="hospital" key="431">Army Medical Museum</name>.]  The
                                &#339;sophagus was very pale. The right lung, twenty-three
                                        ounces, was well filled with air except in its third lobe,
                                        which was intensely congested, and in the lower part of its
                                        first lobe, which was carnified; the left lung, nineteen
                                        ounces, showed carnified portions here and there among
                                        healthy tissue and the bronchial tubes of its lower lobe
                                        contained a false membrane similar to that found in the
                                        trachea. The pleur&#230; enclosed twenty-six ounces of dark-red
                                        serum, contained chiefly in the right cavity. Mixed clots
                                        were found in the right cavities of the heart and venous
                                        clots in the left cavities, aorta, ven&#230; cav&#230; and pulmonary
                                        artery; the pericardium contained eight ounces of
                                        straw-colored serum. The liver and intestines were healthy,
                                        the kidneys congested, and the spleen, which weighed twelve
                                        ounces and a half, was dark-colored and pultaceous.&#8212;<hi rend="italic"><name type="person" key="245">Ass't Surgeon H.
