      Payne</name>, <name type="organization" key="500">Co. D, 20th Colored Troops</name>, aged 19
     years, was wounded in the right foot, near <name type="place" key="xx">Petersburg</name>, <date type="injury" when="1864-06-07">June 7, 1864</date>, and entered <name type="hospital" key="165">Mount Pleasant Hospital</name>, at Washington, <date type="admit" when="1864-06-10">three days
     afterwards</date>.  <name type="person" key="339">Assistant Surgeon C. A. McCall</name>, <name type="organization" key="190">U. S. A.</name>, reported: "Accidental gunshot wound through
     tendo-achillis, passing through the ankle joint and emerging almost at right angle with the
     line of entrance, literally grinding the <choice><orig>astragalus</orig><reg>talus</reg></choice> and part of the os calcis. Sanguineous
     fluid was discharged from the wounds, and the foot became somewhat œdematous as far as
     above the malleoli. Two weeks after the patient's admission his pulse grew weaker, more
     compressible, and frequent, which was attended by loss of "appetite and sleep. On <date type="operation" when="1864-06-27">June 27th</date>, an
     anæsthetic consisting of equal parts of ether and chloroform was administered, and the leg
     was amputated by the circular method, by <name type="person" key="1305">Acting Assistant
      Surgeon A. Transue</name>, the bone being divided one and a half inches above the malleoli.
     The patient reacted finely, and after the operation his appetite improved, he slept well, and
     the parts looked favorable."  On <date type="transfer" when="1864-10-08">October 8th</date>, he
     was transferred to hospital at <name type="place">New Albany</name>, where a second operation was performed by <name type="person" key="xx">Acting Assistant Surgeon W. A. Clapp</name>, who contributed the
     following description of the case: "The patient stated that he contracted syphilis previous to
     being wounded. Extensive necrosis of the shafts of the tibia and fibula followed the first
     amputation, and the pain and discharge from the stump became so great as to necessitate a re-amputation, which was performed
     by the circular method, three inches below the knee, on <date type="operation" when="1865-03-18">March 18, 1865</date>. At the time of the
     operation firm sequestra had formed and there was great swelling of the soft parts. The
     subsequent progress was favorable."  The patient was ultimately discharged from service, at the
     Joe Holt Hospital, <name type="place">Jeffersonville</name>, <date type="servicedischarge" when="1865-08-01">August 1, 1865</date>, and pensioned, and one year
     afterwards he was furnished with an artificial limb of the Palmer patent.  The bones removed at
     the second amputation were subsequently contributed to <name type="hospital" key="431">the Museum</name> by <name type="person" key="1304">Dr. T. W. Fry</name>, late Surgeon <name type="organization" key="132">U. S. V.</name>, who at the same time stated that the man was in
     good health and walking about on crutches, with a good stump, which had healed kindly.  The
     specimen is numbered 4740 of the Surgical Section, and is represented in <hi rend="initialcap">P</hi>LATE <hi rend="initialcap">LXXII</hi>, <hi rend="initialcap">F</hi>IGURE 1, opposite page 317, <hi rend="italic">ante</hi>.  The pensioner was paid <date type="pension" when="1880-03-04">March 4, 1880</date>.</p>
