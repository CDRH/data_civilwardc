The first notes were taken January 14th. The diagnosis at that time was typhoid fever; the usual symptoms of that disease were present, and the patient was delirious at times. There was no perceptible change until January 17th, when he complained of a severe pain in his chest. On percussion slight <choice><orig>dulness</orig><reg>dullness</reg></choice> was detected over the lower lobe of the left lung, but nothing abnormal was discovered by auscultation. He had a slight cough, with rusty-colored expectoration. The treatment was at first stimulant; on the appearance of pulmonary symptoms an expectorant mixture was ordered, with counter-irritation over the seat of pain.  Died, <date type="death" when="1863-01-19">January 19th</date>.  <hi rend="italic">Autopsy</hi> <date type="autopsy" when="1863-01-19">one hour after death</date>: There was some effusion in the subarachnoid space and in the lateral ventricles. Strong adhesions were found on the anterior surface of the right lung; the right lung weighed eighteen ounces and a quarter, the left thirteen ounces and a half; the lower lobe of the left lung was congested hypostatically and presented a circumscribed region of hepatization; stellate spots of black pigment were scattered through the upper lobe. The heart weighed eight ounces and a half. The spleen weighed seventeen ounces and a half and was of a dark-purple color. The liver was pale and weighed seventy-four ounces. The kidneys weighed five ounces and three-quarters each. Ulcerations were observed on the transverse rug&#230; of the jejunum. The colon was contracted. The mesenteric glands were greatly enlarged.&#8212;<name type="person" key="244">Assistant Surgeon George M. McGill</name>, <name type="organization" key="190">U. S. A.</name></p>
