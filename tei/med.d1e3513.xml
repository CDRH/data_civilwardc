                                                >October 3</date>. His pulse was 85, full and
                                        strong; skin natural; tongue moist and furred yellowish. He
                                        was somewhat dull and had pain in the head, anorexia and
                                        relaxed meteorized bowels. Blue-pill was given with opium
                                        every two hours. Rose-colored spots appeared on the chest
                                        and abdomen on the 5th, and on the 7th were very profuse.
                                        The tongue, from being covered with a thick yellow fur,
                                        became red at the tip and margins, remaining coated on the
                                        dorsum. The diarrh&#339;a caused three or four stools
                                        daily, and was accompanied by tympanites and right iliac,
                                        umbilical and, indeed, general abdominal tenderness. Sixteen
                                        grains of quinine were given on the forenoon of the 7th. The
                                        headache, anorexia and other symptoms as stated continued
                                        until the 14th, when, after a free perspiration during the
                                        night, the pulse fell to 66, the bowels became quiet and the
                                        appetite returned; the tongue, however, remained coated
                                        heavily with a moist yellow fur at the base and centre. A
                                        small dose of blue-pill was given on the 16th, but the fur
                                        was not removed until the 23d. Rose-spots appeared on the
                                        16th and again on the 19th. Nocturnal perspirations were
                                        recorded on the 17th and 19th. Some cough occurred during
                                        the progress of the case. The patient was returned to duty
                                        on <date type="duty" when="1861-10-28">the 28th</date>. </p>
