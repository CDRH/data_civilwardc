                        John H. Booker</name>, <name type="organization" key="423">Co. L, 1st Maine
                        Heavy Artillery</name>, aged 23 years, was wounded in the engagement at <name type="place">City
                            Point, Virginia</name>, <date type="injury" when="1864-06-18">June 18th, 1864</date>.  The missile struck the skull at the junction of the coronal and sagittal
                    sutures, lacerating the scalp, and fracturing and depressing the outer table
                    nearly one-half inch each way. At the same time the patient received gunshot
                    wounds of the back and thigh.  He was admitted to the hospital of the 3d
                        division, Second Army Corps, and on <date type="transfer" when="1864-07-02">July
                        2d</date> was sent to the <name type="hospital" key="189">3d division
                            hospital</name> at <name type="place">Alexandria, Virginia</name>.  The injuries healed kindly until
                    <date type="injury" when="1864-07-18">July 18th</date>, when the wound of the thigh became gangrenous, the disease extending
                    over a surface of three inches. Lotions of chloride of zinc and afterward of
                    creosote were applied, and tonics and anodynes given.  On <date type="operation" when="1864-08-10">August 10th</date>, a piece of
                    exfoliated bone half an inch in diameter was removed from the wound of head,
                    and, on <date type="operation" when="1864-08-25">August 25th</date>, two more pieces of the same size were taken away. The
                    slough had separated on August 1st, and the wound had again assumed a healthy
                    appearance, and continued to improve during the months of September and October,
                    when, about <date type="injury" when="1864-11">the middle of November</date>, the hands and feet became
                    &#339;dematous, the face grew puffy, and finally the abdomen commenced to
                    swell. By <date type="injury" when="1864-12">the middle of December</date> the girth of the body at the umbilicus was
                    thirty-eight inches. But little urine was passed, yet no symptoms of cerebral
                    disturbance were noticed.  The patient died <date type="death" when="1865-01-09">January 9th, 1865</date>.  At the autopsy, the cavities of the chest and
                    peritoneum were found much distended with serum, and the kidneys were completely
                    degenerated.   The case is reported by <name type="person" key="134">Surgeon E. Bentley</name>, <name type="organization" key="132">U. S. V.</name></p>
