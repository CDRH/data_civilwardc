                                        remittent fever.]  Symptoms on admission: Pulse varying from
                                        90 to 110, feeble and thready; skin hot and dry; tongue dry,

                                        with sordes; deafness; stupor; low delirium. When undisturbed he lay with his eyes
                                        half closed muttering broken and unconnected sentences; when
                                        aroused he had a vacant expression and was unable to answer
                                        correctly. During the first twenty-four hours after
                                        admission he had four passages from the bowels; the abdomen
                                        was tympanitic, very tender over the small intestine and
                                        c&#230;cum, and marked with a few petechi&#230; and
                                        sudamina. Turpentine emulsion, laudanum and milk-punch were
                                        administered.  Next day there was a slight improvement: The
                                        pulse became somewhat stronger, the tongue less tremulous
                                        and protruded with more ease; the patient was able to answer
                                        a few questions correctly, but the abdominal symptoms
                                        continued and there was some epistaxis.  On December 2 the
                                        pulse became somewhat stronger and less frequent, the tongue
                                        quite moist, the sordes partially removed and the
                                        diarrh&#339;a checked; but at 9 P. M. the
                                        diarrh&#339;a returned, several involuntary stools were
                                        passed and the patient fell into a stupor from which he
                                        never aroused.  He died at 3 A. M. of <date type="death"
