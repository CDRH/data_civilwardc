                                        constipation. The record is silent as to his condition until
                                        the 13th, when he was dull and dejected and talked much in
                                        his sleep, having a hot and dry skin, a dry tongue, rough
                                        and coated but clean and moist at the edges, some pain in
                                        swallowing, diarrh&#339;a, abdominal pain and slight
                                        iliac tenderness, with headache and flushed cheeks, rapid
                                        pulse and occasional epistaxis. The fever increased towards
                                        evening and was followed by a chill. From the 14th to the
                                        18th he had delirium at night but was rational during the
                                        day; his bowels were slightly relaxed, the stools thin and
                                        watery, and there was much abdominal tenderness. Quinine was
                                        ordered on the 14th, tincture of iron and turpentine
                                        emulsion on the 15th; epistaxis was noted on the 16th and
                                        deafness on the 17th. On the 18th delirium gave place to

                                        and stupidity, which increased until on the 21st the
                                        patient was unable to protrude his tongue well and swallowed
                                        with difficulty; there was epistaxis; cough became
                                        troublesome and the expectoration was tinged with blood,
                                        which was conceived to be owing to the epistaxis. From this
                                        time to the 30th, when the daily record ends, there was
                                        little change in the symptoms. The patient was discharged
