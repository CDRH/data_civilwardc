                                        lungs were somewhat engorged posteriorly. The heart was
                                        flabby and contained a small clot in both sides, larger in
                                        the right than in the left. The liver was firm and somewhat
                                        congested, its surface of an intense bluish-slate color,
                                        which coloration extended two lines into the parenchyma; the
                                        gall-bladder contained an ounce of dark-brown bile; the
                                        spleen was of a purple color with an admixture of brown and
                                        was extremely firm; the pancreas was white and not very
                                        firm. The ileum, in its six lower feet, was extensively
                                        ulcerated; about two feet above the ileo-c&#230;cal
                                        valve was a Peyer's patch of an irregular circular shape,
                                        presenting three distinct ulcers with high blackish walls
                                        and stone-gray bases, in one of which was a small
                                        perforation which had caused some exudation of lymph on the
                                        peritoneal coat. The kidneys were healthy.&#8212;<hi
