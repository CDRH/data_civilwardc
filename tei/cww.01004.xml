                    <p>Your Petitioner <persName>Caroline Robinson</persName> respectfully represents that she is of African descent, is about thirty five years of age, of yellow complexion &#38; of medium height. That on the <date when="1862-04-16">16th day of April 1862</date>, she resided in the <placeName>District of Columbia</placeName> and had done so for several years previously. That on the said <date when="1862-04-16">16th day of April 1862</date>, she belonged to <persName>William M Merrick</persName> and his wife <persName>Mary Merrick</persName> by whom she was then and there held to service and labor; and that the said <persName>William M Merrick</persName> &#38; his said wife then and before resided in the <placeName>District of Columbia</placeName>.</p>
                    <p>She further alleges that by virtue of an act of Congress entitled "An act for the release of certain persons held to service or labor in the <placeName>District of Columbia</placeName>" approved <date when="1862-04-16">16th of April 1862</date>, she was emancipated, discharged &#38; set free of &#38; from all claim on the part of said <persName>Merrick</persName> &#38; wife to her service and labor as aforesaid.

                    <p>In consideration whereof your Petitioner prays that in pursuance of the 2nd &#38; 3rd sections of an act of Congress approved <date when="1862-07-12">July 12th 1862</date> entitled "an act supplementary to the act for the release of certain persons held to service or labor in the <placeName>District of Columbia</placeName>" approved <date when="1862-04-16">April 16th 1862</date> the foregoing schedule or description of herself may be accepted &#38; filed &#38; that a certificate in proper form declaring her to be freed &#38; discharged from said claim to service &#38; labor &#38; manumitted by the provisions of the Act aforesaid of <date when="1862-04-12">12th April 1862</date> may be issued to her by the said Clerk of the circuit court for the <placeName>District of Columbia</placeName>. And she will ever pray &#38;c</p>
