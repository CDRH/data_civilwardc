Diarrh&#339;a.  [This man appears on the register of the hospital of the 2d Division of the Cavalry Corps of the <name type="organization" key="377">army of the Potomac</name> , admitted <date type="admit" when="1864-11-02">November 2d</date>&#8212;remittent fever&#8212;sent to depot hospital <date type="transfer" when="1864-11-20">November 20th</date>. He is borne on the register of the depot hospital of the Cavalry Corps, <name type="place">City Point, Virginia</name>, admitted <date type="admit" when="1864-11-20">November 20th</date>&#8212;diarrh&#339;a&#8212;sent to general hospital <date type="transfer" when="1864-11-29">November 29th</date>.]  Was much emaciated and exhausted; complained of pain in the bowels; had suffered from diarrh&#339;a for several weeks before admission. Three blue-mass pills were given, followed by castor oil; afterward opiates, stimulants and astringents. He continued to have on an average five or six stools daily, and gradually failed. The last week of his illness he had but two or three evacuations daily.  Died, <date type="death" when="1864-12-06">December 6th</date>.  <hi rend="italic">Autopsy</hi> <date type="autopsy" when="1864-12-06">twelve hours after death</date>: There was some engorgement of the posterior portion of both lungs. The pericardium was adherent to the heart. The liver presented the nutmeg appearance. The spleen was very small. The mucous membrane of the intestines was considerably injected; this was most marked in the large intestine. In the descending colon, sigmoid flexure, and rectum the mucous membrane was ulcerated.</p> 
   <p>&#8432; It is to be regretted that, in most instances, the records of this hospital do not show by whom the autopsies were made. It is known that many of them were made by <name type="person" key="134">Surgeon Bentley</name> himself, or under his immediate supervision, but it is only possible to distinguish these from the others in a few cases.</p>
