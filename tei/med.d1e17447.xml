                                                  fragment of shell, which evacuated the humors of
                                                  the right eye, and fractured the nasal bones and
                                                  right superior maxilla. The treatment consisted in

                                                  was a small fistula, communicating, probably, with

                                                  about the orbits as to secure a cicatrix, showing

                                                  induced by his wound, made it impracticable for
                                                  him to obtain employment. Thus his mutilation was
                                                  a doubly cruel one.</p>
