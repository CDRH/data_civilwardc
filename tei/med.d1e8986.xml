                                        the course of the large blood vessels, there was in several
                                        places a gelatinous subarachnoid deposit; the subarachnoid

                                        several places; the solitary follicles of the c&#230;cum
                                        and of the first six inches of the colon were ulcerated; the

                                        glands adjacent to the ulcerated intestinal glands were
