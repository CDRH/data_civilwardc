                    Sergeant, <name type="organization" key="236">Co. A, 31st Maine
                        Volunteers</name>, aged 20 years, was wounded at the battle of <name type="BATTLE" key="250"><choice><orig>Spottsylvania</orig><reg>Spotsylvania</reg></choice> Court House, Virginia</name>, <date type="injury" when="1864-05-12">May 12th, 1864</date>, by a conoidal ball,
                    which entered the left side of the head, one inch behind the meatus auditorius
                    externus, on a line with its opening, and emerged close to the acromion process
                    of the right scapula.  He was entirely unconscious for several hours, but had
                    some realization of pain in the evening, when he made an ineffectual effort to
                    get on his feet.  He was admitted to the hospital of the 2d division of the Ninth
                        Corps, and, on <date type="transfer" when="1864-05-24">May 24th</date>, was sent
                    to the <name type="hospital" key="173">Harewood Hospital</name>, Washington. For
                    about three weeks there was much mental aberration, especially at night.  <name type="person" key="425">Assistant Surgeon Sumner A. Patten</name>, who
                    reports the case, examined the patient on <date type="injury" when="1864-06-20">June 20th, 1864</date>. The wounds of
                    entrance and of exit discharged freely. There was numbness of the left side of
                    the head, and deafness of the left ear. The scalp in the vicinity of the wound
                    was much swollen. On rising to his feet, he was so dizzy that he was compelled
                    to lay hold of something to avoid falling. Occasionally small pieces of necrosed
                    bone were discharged from the left ear.  <name type="person" key="426">Sergeant
                        Benson</name>, commissioned as lieutenant, on <date type="duty" when="1864-08-01">August 1st</date>, returned to his regiment, but, on <date type="resigned" when="1864-12-05">December 5th, 1864</date>, resigned.  On
                    <date type="injury" when="1866-04-02">April 2d, 1866</date>, <name type="person" key="425">Doctor Patten</name> wrote that
                    this officer had not been able to labor since the reception of the injury; that
                    there was a constant feeling of weakness, although his appetite was generally
                    good. Confusion of thought and impairment of memory were also well-marked
                    effects of the injury. His general health was deteriorated, and he weighed but
                    144 pounds, having weighed 163 when he enlisted.  In <date type="pension" when="1868-09">September, 1868</date>, <name type="person" key="427">Examining Surgeon E. F. Sanger</name> reported that this pensioner,
                    residing in <name type="place">Bangor, Maine</name>, had total deafness of the left ear, and that his
                    general health was very poor, and his disabilities total. In a previous
                    communication, <name type="person" key="429">Pension Examiner J. C.
                        Weston</name> reported that frequent abscesses formed about the mastoid
                    process, due probably to caries. </p>
