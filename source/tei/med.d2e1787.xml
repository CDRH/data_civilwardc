      Chase</name>, <name type="organization" key="339">Co. L, 1st Maine Cavalry</name>, aged 43
     years, was wounded at <name type="BATTLE" key="264">Stony Creek</name>, <date type="injury" when="1864-10-27">October 27, 1864</date>, and admitted to the field hospital of the 2d division, Cavalry Corps, where <name type="person" key="xx">Surgeon F. LeMoyne</name>, <name type="organization" key="223">16th Pennsylvania
       Cavalry</name>, noted: "Shot flesh wound of both legs." The patient was moved to <name type="place">City Point</name> on <date type="transfer" when="1864-10-28">the following day</date>, and on <date type="transfer" when="1864-11-14">November14th</date> he was transferred to <name type="place" key="#Washington">Washington</name>. <name type="person" key="123">Surgeon D. W. Bliss</name>, <name type="organization" key="132">U. S. V.</name>,
     made the following report: "He was admitted to <name type="hospital" key="171">Armory Square
      Hospital</name> with wounds of the right thigh and left leg. The first ball entered the thigh
     posteriorly, about the junction of the middle and upper thirds, passing inward and a little
     downward, and emerging on the inner side of the thigh; the second ball entered the left leg on
     the posterior aspect, about the middle, and passed directly forward, emerging on the inner
     side, one and a half or two inches from point of entrance. The patient had an unhealthy
     appearance and was considerably emaciated when admitted, the wounds discharging a very thin and
     offensive matter, not very profusely. On November 26th, pyæmia became developed; patient
     had several violent chills, which were repeated on the following days, when his wounds became
     dark colored and dry and ceased to discharge, and he grew delirious. From this period quinine,
     iron, and chlorate of potassa were prescribed, with stimulants and the most nourishing diet,
     together with applications of creasote, tannin, and solution of chlorate of <choice><sic>patassa</sic><corr>potassa</corr></choice> to the wounds, under which treatment he gradually improved. At
     present (December 31st) his wounds are about healed and he is able to leave his bed, being
     greatly improved in every respect, and convalescent." The man was discharged from service <date type="servicedischarge" when="1865-03-24">March 24, 1865</date>, because of "permanent contraction of
     the gastrocnemius muscle of the left leg, resulting from the wound." <name type="person" key="xx">Examiner J. O. Perry</name>, of <name type="place" key="xx">Portland,
       Maine</name>, certified, <date type="pension" when="1868-04-30">April 30, 1868</date>, that "both wounds are very tender;" and that "the
     wound in the leg so far involved the nerves that the leg below it and the foot are quite numb."
     The <name type="organization" key="xx">Portland Examining Board</name> reported, in <date type="pension" when="1873">1873</date> and
     <date type="pension" when="1875">1875</date>, that they find deep, and, on the left leg, adherent scars, with considerable loss of
     tissues in both wounds. The pensioner was paid <date type="pension" when="1876-06-04">June 4, 1876</date>. </p>
