                                        typho-malarial fever. He had frequently suffered from
                                        intermittent fever. When admitted he had been sick for some
                                        time and was greatly emaciated; he had some
                                        diarrhœa; his tongue was coated in the middle, dry
                                        and cracked; pulse 132. After this his breathing became
                                        hurried, and coarse mucous râles were heard over both lungs;
                                        there was also marked nervous prostration.  He died on <date type="death" when="1863-06-21">the 21st</date>.  <hi rend="italic">Post-mortem</hi> examination

                                        slight. The brain was normal. The mucous membrane of the
                                        œsophagus was of a pale purple color. The trachea
                                        contained much bronchial secretion; its mucous membrane was
                                        purplish. The upper and middle lobes of the right lung were
                                        solidified except their anterior free borders, which were
                                        pale and healthy; the lower lobe was congested
                                        hypostatically but not solidified. The posterior portion of
                                        the left lung was in a state of gray hepatization, the
                                        anterior part healthy. The right lung weighed twenty-seven
                                        ounces and a quarter, the left thirty-seven ounces; the
                                        bronchial glands were large, one of them softened. The
                                        pericardium was lined by recent lymph roughened by papillary
                                        elevations; it contained six drachms of flaky serum. The
                                        right cavities of the heart contained a large venous clot,
                                        the left cavities a mixed clot which extended into the
                                        aorta. The liver weighed fifty-seven ounces, it was pale and
                                        slightly softened; the gall-bladder contained a drachm of
                                        greenish-brown viscid bile. The spleen was firm and weighed
                                        three ounces and three-quarters. The pancreas was firm and
                                        white, it weighed two ounces and a half. The right kidney
                                        weighed five ounces and a quarter, the left five and a half,
                                        both were pale and flabby. No prominent lesion was observed
                                        in the intestines; the lower part of the jejunum was
                                        contracted and its mucous membrane pale; Peyer's patches
                                        were rather pale and dotted with points of black pigment;
                                        the large intestine was contracted and its mucous membrane
