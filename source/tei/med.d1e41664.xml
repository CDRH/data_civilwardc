   <p>Case from the case-book of the <name type="hospital" key="501"><hi rend="initialcap">T</hi>HIRD <hi rend="initialcap">D</hi>IVISION</name> of the <name type="place" key="#Alexandria"><hi rend="initialcap">A</hi>LEXANDRIA</name> <hi rend="initialcap">H</hi>OSPITAL, <name type="person" key="134">Surgeon Edwin Bentley</name>, <name type="organization" key="132">U.

   <p><hi rend="initialcap">C</hi>ASE 522.—<name type="person" key="xxx">Recruit George Wayne</name>, <name type="organization" key="xxx">79th New York volunteers</name>; age 18; admitted <date type="admit" when="1864-09-09">September 9, 1864</date>.  Acute diarrhœa.  [This man appears on the register of the <name type="hospital" key="218">Augur hospital</name>, near <name type="place" key="#Alexandria">Alexandria, Virginia</name>, admitted <date type="admit" when="1864-09-05">September 5th</date>—remittent fever—sent to general hospital <date type="transfer" when="1864-09-09">September 9th</date>.]  Treatment: Hope's camphor mixture, milk-punch, &amp;c.  The diarrhœa was speedily brought under control, but several relapses took place, and the patient remained weak.  November 20th: Typhoid symptoms set in, and a turpentine mixture was prescribed.  November 23d: He was attacked by diphtheria, and died <date type="death" when="1864-11-29">November 29th</date>.  In the treatment of this last complication milk-punch was given freely, and the throat swabbed alternately with solution of chlorate of potassa and dilute acetic acid. A large quantity of pseudomembrane was thus removed.  <hi rend="italic">Autopsy</hi> <date type="autopsy" when="1864-11-30">thirteen hours after death</date>: The pharynx, larynx, trachea, and bronchial tubes were inflamed, and presented ulcerated patches. The upper lobes of both lungs were pneumonic. The liver and spleen were much enlarged and softened, the latter being very soft; the gall-bladder was distended with bile. There was extensive inflammation and ulceration of the mucous membrane of the bowels. In the cæcum several cicatrices of former ulcers were observed.</p> 
   <p>⃰ It is to be regretted that, in most instances, the records of this hospital do not show by whom the autopsies were made. It is known that many of them were made by <name type="person" key="134">Surgeon Bentley</name> himself, or under his immediate supervision, but it is only possible to distinguish these from the others in a few cases.</p>
