                near <name type="BATTLE" key="254">Petersburg, Virginia</name>, <date type="injury" when="1864-11-10">November 10th, 1864</date>, by a conoidal ball which lacerated
                the scalp, and contused the anterior portion of the left parietal bone. He was
                admitted to the field hospital of the <name type="hospital">3d division, Second
                    Corps</name>, and thence transferred to <name type="hospital">City Point</name>,
                and thence sent by the <name type="hospital">hospital steamer Connecticut</name> to
                the <name type="hospital" key="175">Stanton Hospital</name>, Washington, where he
                arrived on <date type="transfer" when="1864-11-26">November 26th</date>. There was a
                necrosis of the cranium, one-fourth of an inch in diameter. Low diet and gentle
                purgatives were prescribed, and, as suppuration became tolerably well established,
                emollient poultices were applied to the wound. On <date type="operation" when="1864-12-21">the 21st of December</date>, the contused bone had become
                loosened by the process of absorption and suppuration. The patient was placed under
                the influence of chloroform, and <name type="person" key="405">Surgeon Benjamin B.
                    Wilson</name>, <name type="organization" key="132">U. S. V.</name>, made a
                crucial incision, and removed a piece of the external table of the parietal bone,
                half an inch in diameter, and another, from the internal table, one-fourth of an
                inch in diameter. On <date type="operation" when="1864-12-29">the 29th</date>,
                another piece of bone, including a small portion of both tables, was removed from
                the inferior margin of the wound. Water dressings were applied. The patient made a
                rapid recovery, without any untoward symptom; but it was thought inexpedient to
                return him immediately to active service in the field. He did efficient duty for
                some months as a nurse in the hospital. When discharged, on the general muster out
                of troops, <date type="servicedischarge" when="1865-06-15">June 15th, 1865</date>,
                he was in excellent health. His name does not appear on the list of applicants for
                pension. The specimen (see <hi rend="initialcap">F</hi>IG. 40) and notes of the case
                were contributed by <name type="person" key="405">Surgeon B. B. Wilson</name>, <name type="organization" key="132">U. S. V. </name>
