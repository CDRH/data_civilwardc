            <div1 type="petition" subtype="handwritten">
                <p>To the Commissioners under the Act of Congress approved the <date when="1862-04-16">16th April 1862</date>, entitled "An Act for the release
                    of certain persons held to service or labor in the <placeName>District of
                        Columbia</placeName>.</p>

                <p>Your Petitioner, <persName>Emanuel D Etchison</persName> of
                        <placeName>Washington, DC</placeName>, by this his petition in writing
                    represents and states, that he is a person loyal to the <placeName>United
                        States</placeName>, who, at the time of the passage of the said Act of
                    Congress, held a claim to service or labor against two persons of African
                    descent of the name of <persName>Frank</persName> &amp; <persName>Joseph
                        Mason</persName>, for and during the life of the said
                        <persName>Frank</persName>, and <persName>Joseph Mason</persName>; and that,
                    by the said Act of Congress, the said <persName>Frank</persName> and
                        <persName>Joseph Mason</persName> are discharged and freed of and from all
                    claim of your petitioner to such service or labor; that at the time of said
                    discharge said <persName>Frank</persName> and <persName>Joseph Mason</persName>
                    were respectively the former of the age of seventeen years, and the other of the
                    age of fifteen years; the said <persName>Frank</persName> being of dark copper
                    color, five feet high, has a high forehead, snow white teeth, full chest, a heavy
                    suit of hair, good open countenance and free and polite in conversation, sound
                    in mind and body and perfectly healthy. The said <persName>Joseph
                        Mason</persName> is very black, about four feet five inches high and stoutly
                    built for his age, rather grim countenance when spoken to, has a small scar over
                    the left eye lengthwise the brow scarcely perceptible, remarkably healthy and
                    sound in mind and body.</p>

                <p>That your petitioner acquired his title to the aforesaid service or <choice><sic>labour</sic><corr>labor</corr></choice> of said <persName>Frank</persName> by <pb xml:id="leaf001v" facs="cww.00653.002.jpg"/> purchase of <persName>J Hill</persName> of
                        <placeName>Baltimore</placeName> on the <date when="1861-03-30">30th day of
                        March 1861</date>, for the price or sum of Seven hundred and fifty dollars;
                    and of the said <persName>Joseph Mason</persName> by purchase of <persName>R H
                        Harrison</persName> of <placeName>Baltimore</placeName>, on the <date when="1861-04-09">9th of April 1861</date>, for the price or sum of Eight
                    hundred and twenty five dollars. That your petitioners claim to the service or <choice><sic>labour</sic><corr>labor</corr></choice> of the said <persName>Frank</persName> was, at the time of said discharge therefrom, of the value of One thousand dollars in money, he being a
                    valuable and experienced hotel servant without any defect or infirmity: and of
                    the said <persName>Joseph Mason</persName>, of the value of One thousand dollars in money, he being a trusty and faithful
                    office servant, without any infirmity or defect.</p>

                <p>Your petitioner hereby declares that he bears true and faithful allegiance to the
                    government of the <placeName>United States</placeName>, and that he has not
                    borne arms against the <placeName>United States</placeName> in the present
                    rebellion, nor in any way given aid or comfort thereto.</p>

                <p>And he further states and alleges that he has not brought said
                        <persName>Frank</persName> &amp; <persName>Joseph Mason</persName> into the
                        <placeName>District of Columbia</placeName> since the passage of the said Act of
                    Congress; and that, at the time of the passage thereof, said
                        <persName>Frank</persName> and <persName>Joseph Mason</persName> were held
                    to service or <choice><sic>labour</sic><corr>labor</corr></choice> therein under and by virtue of your petitioner's claim to such service
                    or <choice><sic>labour</sic><corr>labor</corr></choice>.</p>

                <p>Your petitioner further states and alleges that his said claim to the service or <choice><sic>labour</sic><corr>labor</corr></choice> of the said <persName>Frank</persName> and <persName>Joseph Mason</persName>, does not originate in or by virtue of any transfer
                    heretofore made by any person who has in any manner aided or <pb xml:id="leaf002r" facs="cww.00653.003.jpg"/>sustained the present rebellion
                    against the Government of the <placeName>United States</placeName>.</p>

                <p>And your petitioner prays the said Commissioners to investigate and determine the
                    validity of his said claim to the service and labor of the said
                        <persName>Frank</persName> and <persName>Joseph Mason</persName> herein
                    above set forth; and if the same be found to be valid, that they appraise and
                    apportion the value of the said claim in money and report the same to the
                    Secretary of the Treasury of the <placeName>United States</placeName>, in
                    conformity to the provisions of said act of Congress.</p>
