                                                  there was no emphysema or other sign of injury to
                                                  the pleura or lung. Some small spiculæ of bone,
                                                  which had worked to the surface posteriorly, were
                                                  removed, and the chest nearly encircled by
                                                  adhesive straps. Antimonial and saline mixtures
                                                  were administered, and low diet ordered. August
                                                  1st: Some friction sound at point of fracture,
                                                  but no effusion and no pneumonia. Tincture of
                                                  veratrum viride was ordered, and, as the pulse was
                                                  105, calomel was administered, but a better diet
                                                  was given as his strength was failing. A pulmonary
                                                  fistula was established on <date type="injury" when="1862-08-02">August 2d</date>. Air issued,
                                                  with a bubbling sound, anteriorly and posteriorly,
                                                  on coughing or sneezing. By intercepting the air
                                                  by pressure between the points of wounding and the
                                                  point of fracture, the fistula and fracture were
                                                  found to be identical in position. There was no
                                                  effusion, no pneumonia, no collapse of the lung,
                                                  and no emphysema, on account, it was supposed, of
                                                  the free exit afforded by the wound to the air,
                                                  and it was, therefore, judged that the pleura was
                                                  adherent about the point of fistula. His weakness
                                                  increasing, punch, iron, and quinine were ordered
                                                  freely. The bandage was still continued. August
                                                  4th: The sputum is now tinged with blood; pulse,
                                                  105; strength poor; fistula still exists. A slight
                                                  friction sound was still perceptible, but
                                                  localized at the fistula. Vomiting and diarrhœa
                                                  have set in. Anodynes and astringents were given,
                                                  and the nutritious diet continued, with a
                                                  diaphoretic for the slight pneumonia. Over the
                                                  subcutaneous fistulous point a compress was
                                                  applied, and bandaged firmly in hopes of its
                                                  closing. August 7th: Pneumonic sputum
                                                  disappeared. Anterior orifice closed entirely;
                                                  posterior one cicatrizing; fistula entirely gone.
                                                  There is now no <choice><orig>dulness</orig><reg>dullness</reg></choice>, no effusion, though the
                                                  friction sound continues. No cough; pulse, 95.
                                                  Compress removed. Bandage and nutritious diet
                                                  continued. Diarrhœa gone. August 15th: The
                                                  pleurisy is marked, the fracture uniting. There is
                                                  no effusion or pneumonia, and the patient is
                                                  gaining strength decidedly. The fistula has not
                                                  returned, and the posterior orifice has almost
                                                  healed. His diet is less nourishing, and the
