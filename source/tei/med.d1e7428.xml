                    Musician, <name type="organization" key="592">Co. K, 44th New York
                        Volunteers</name>, was wounded, at the battle
                    of <name type="BATTLE" key="263">Cold Harbor, Virginia</name>, <date type="injury" when="1864-06-03">June
                        3d, 1864</date>, by a conoidal musket ball, which struck the frontal bone on
                    the right side, near the median line, and glanced, apparently causing only a
                    flesh wound; the bone was barely bruised.  He was admitted to the hospital of the
                        Fifth Corps, and, on <date type="transfer" when="1864-06-10">June 10th</date>, was
                    sent to the <name type="hospital" key="167">Carver Hospital</name> at
                    Washington.  The case progressed favorably until June 20th, when grave cephalic
                    symptoms came on.  The patient became comatose, and died on <date type="death" when="1864-06-22">June 22d, 1864</date>, from cerebral complications.  The
                    autopsy revealed a large abscess in the right anterior lobe of the brain, with
                    meningitis beneath the seat of injury. The external table of the bone was
                    slightly discolored and cribriform, while the internal presented a faint attempt
                    at the formation of a circumscribed area of the effects of osteitis. The diploe
                    was found of a dark yellowish gray color, as in cases of osteomyelitis in long
                    bones.  The pathological specimen was sent to the <name type="hospital" key="431">Army Medical Museum</name>, and is numbered 1393 in Section I.   The specimen
                    and history were contributed by <name type="person" key="245">Assistant Surgeon
                        H. Allen</name>, <name type="organization" key="190">U. S. Army</name>. </p>
