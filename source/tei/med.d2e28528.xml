     years, was wounded in the right knee, at <name type="BATTLE" key="3"><choice><orig>Spottsylvania</orig><reg>Spotsylvania</reg></choice></name>, <date type="injury" when="1864-05-10">May 10, 1864</date>, by a musket ball, which
     shattered the head of the fibula and the posterior surface of the tibia, lodging between the
     gastrocnemius and soleus muscles. He was admitted to <name type="hospital" key="152">Finley
      Hospital</name>, Washington, <date type="admit" when="1864-05-24">two weeks after the injury</date>, the wound appearing healthy and his
     general condition being good. A day or two afterwards the patient complained of soreness in the
     throat, and on May 29th marked symptoms of tetanus, such as rigidity of the muscles of the jaw
     and difficulty of mastication and deglutition, existed.  On <date type="operation" when="1864-05-30">May 30th</date> circular amputation at the lower third of the
     thigh was performed by <name type="person" key="332">Acting Assistant Surgeon F. G. H. Bradford</name>, immediate relief seeming to be afforded by the operation. The following day
     the rigidity of the muscles had partly disappeared and improvement continued until the patient
     was entirely relieved. Further progress in every respect continued favorable and the stump
     healed. The probable cause of the appearance of tetanus was owing to a slight laceration of the
     external popliteal nerve, produced by the ball in its passage through the limb.  On <date type="servicedischarge" when="1865-08-01">August 1, 1865</date>, the patient was discharged from
     service and pensioned, having been previously fitted with a "Jewett" artificial limb. The upper
     portion of the bones of the amputated leg, showing the seat and extent of the injury, were
     contributed to <name type="hospital" key="431">the Museum</name>, with the history of the case,
     by <name type="person" key="332">the operator</name>.</p>
