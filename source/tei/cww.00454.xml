                    necessary to be stated in an ordinary case of a claim under the act to the
                    service of one person only. Where the value of the service of more than one
                    person is claimed in the same petition, the form must be modified and adapted to
                    the circumstances of the case:]</fw>

                <p rend="bold">To the Commissioners under the act of Congress approved the <date when="1862-04-16">16th of April, 1862</date>, entitled "An act for the

                <p>Your Petitioner, <seg type="handwritten"><persName>Lucy E.

                    petition in writing, represents and states, that <seg type="handwritten">she</seg> is a person loyal to the United States, who, at the time of the
                    passage of the said act of Congress, held a claim to service or labor against a
                        <seg type="handwritten">Male</seg> person of African descent of the name of

                    that by said act of Congress said <seg type="handwritten"><persName>Leonard</persName></seg> was discharged and freed of and from
                    all claim of your petitioner to such service or labor; that at the time of said
                    discharge said <seg type="handwritten"><persName>Leonard</persName></seg> was of
                    the age of <seg type="handwritten">about Twenty five Years</seg> and of the

                <p>That your petitioner acquired <seg type="handwritten">her</seg> claim to the
                    aforesaid service or labor of said <seg type="handwritten"><persName>Leonard</persName></seg> in manner following:<note type="government" place="foot" xml:id="n2">Here state how the claim was

                <p>That your petitioner's claim to the service or labor of said <seg type="handwritten"><persName>Leonard</persName></seg> was, at the time of
                    said discharge therefrom, of the value of <seg type="handwritten">Sixteen

                        the same, and also such facts, if any, touching the moral, mental, and

                        service or labor, and that he believes none other to exist. If the
                        petitioner specify no such infirmity or defect, then his statement touching
                        the value of his claim should conclude with an averment that he has no

                        that she knows of no moral, mental or bodily defect or infirmity to impair
                        this valuation.</seg></p>

                <p>Your petitioner hereby declares that <seg type="handwritten">she</seg> bears true
                    and faithful allegiance to the Government of the United States, and that <seg type="handwritten">she</seg> has not borne arms against the United States in
                    the present rebellion, nor in any way given aid or comfort thereto.</p>

                <p>And your petitioner further states and alleges, that <seg type="handwritten">she</seg> has not brought said <seg type="handwritten"><persName>Leonard</persName></seg> into the <placeName>District of Columbia</placeName> since the passage of said act of Congress; and that, at the time of the passage thereof, said <seg type="handwritten"><persName>Leonard</persName></seg> was held to service or labor therein under and by virtue of your petitioner's claim to such service or labor.</p>

                <p>Your petitioner further states and alleges, that <seg type="handwritten">her</seg> said claim to the service or labor of said <seg type="handwritten"><persName>Leonard</persName></seg> does not originate in
                    or by virtue of any transfer heretofore made by any person who has in any manner
                    aided or sustained the present rebellion against the Government of the
                        <placeName>United States</placeName>.</p>

                <p>And your petitioner prays the said Commissioners to investigate and determine the

                    of said <seg type="handwritten"><persName>Leonard</persName></seg> herein above
                    set forth; and if the same be found to be valid, that they appraise and
