                                typhoid fever. The condition of the patient is not stated until six
                                days after admission, when his pulse was weak and compressible, 110;
                                countenance haggard; cheeks sunken; eyes suffused; tongue slightly
                                coated brown and very dry and fissured, as the mouth was open much
                                of the time; he was very deaf and difficult to arouse; he spoke with
                                much effort, and had exquisite tenderness in the epigastric and
                                right iliac regions and spasmodic twitchings of the arms.
                                Whiskey-punch was given every hour. Next day the eruption appeared
                                over the abdomen and the tenderness was very much lessened;
                                sinapisms were applied where the tenderness had been acute. The
                                abdomen became scaphoid on the 10th,
                                the tongue clean and very red, the face much sunken and the eyes
                                suffused and surrounded by dark areolæ; pulse 104; the patient
                                had much thirst, cough and hurried respiration. Next day the
                                countenance was more natural and the tongue moist. On the 12th the expression was better,
                                the eyes clearer, and there was less epigastric and umbilical pain.
                                The sinapisms were repeated on this day. After this the patient
                                gradually improved, although for some days the skin continued dry
                                and husky, the bowels somewhat relaxed, about two thin stools daily,
                                and the right iliac region slightly tender. On <date type="transfer" when="1861-11-01">November 1</date>, when he was transferred
                                to <name type="place">Annapolis, Md.</name>, his pulse was natural,
                                appetite good and bowels regular. </p>
