                            Jersey Volunteers</name>, aged 32 years, was wounded at the battle of <name type="BATTLE" key="127">Bull Run, Virginia</name>, <date type="injury" when="1862-08-29">August 29th, 1862</date>, by a fragment of
                    shell, which fractured and depressed the external table over the coronal suture.  He was, on <date type="admit" when="1862-09-01">September 1st</date>, conveyed
                    to Washington, a distance of thirty miles, and admitted into the <name type="hospital" key="436">Unitarian Church Hospital</name>.  He suffered from
                    paralysis of the right side of the body and retention of urine. Unsuccessful
                    efforts were made to elevate the depressed bone. Cold water dressings were
                    applied.  On September 10th, the power of motion in the arm and leg had returned,
                    and on the 20th, the patient was so far recovered that he was able to walk with
                    the help of a cane. He recovered, with the exception of a slight weakness in the
                    right knee, and some difficulty in voiding his urine, which latter trouble was
                    overcome by small doses of sweet spirits of nitre.  On <date type="transfer" when="1862-10-05">October 5th</date>, he was transferred to <name type="place">New York City</name>
                    and admitted into the City Hospital. Through the wound, which was granulating
                    firmly, necrosed bone could be detected. An attempt was made to remove the
                    latter, but failed.  The patient was discharged from the service on <date type="servicedischarge" when="1863-01-08">January 8th, 1863</date>.  The case
                    is reported by <name type="person" key="1353">Surgeon A. Wynkoop</name>, <name type="organization" key="132">U. S. V.</name>  In <date type="pension" when="1963-01">January, 1863</date>, <name type="person">Dr. H. C.

                    that the man was unable to maintain himself, and was entitled to full pension.
                    His claim for pension was rejected <date type="pension" when="1965-12-29">December 29th, 1865</date>, for want of
