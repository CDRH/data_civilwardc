E, 114th Pennsylvania Volunteers</name>, aged 17 years, was wounded at <name type="BATTLE" key="251">Fredericksburg, Virginia</name>, <date type="injury" when="1862-12-13">December 13th, 1862</date>, by a conoidal ball, which entered the
                                                  right side at the costal cartilage, and emerged at
                                                  the angle of the ninth rib, fracturing the rib
                                                  between the point of entrance and exit. He was
                                                  treated in the field, and, on <date type="transfer" when="1862-12-17">December 17th</date>, was
                                                                sent to <name type="hospital" key="173">Harewood Hospital</name>. When admitted, he
                                                  suffered from traumatic penumonia, which was
                                                  treated by venesection and the administration of
                                                  morphia and antimony. He recovered sufficiently to
                                                  be able to move about the ward. The wound healed
                                                  kindly. On <date type="operation" when="1863-01-11">January 11th</date>, a profuse hæmorrhage
                                                  occurred from the wound, probably from intercostal
                                                  artery, which continued in spite of compression.
                                                  An unsuccessful attempt was made to ligate the
                                                  artery. The hæmorrhage was finally suppressed,
                                                  after an alarming loss of blood, by tight
                                                  bandaging and styptics. The stoppage of the
                                                  hæmorrhage was immediately followed by pain on
                                                  both sides, cough, and expectoration. Pyæmia set
                                                  in, and death occurred on <date type="death" when="1863-01-24">January 24th, 1863</date>.   Necropsy: No opening had been made into the

                                                  Eight abscesses, from the size of a pea to that
