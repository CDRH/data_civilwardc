                    <seg type="handwritten">hundred and seventy five dollars in money or
                        thereabouts, according to the prices which had been paid in cash for similar
                        negroes by those dealing in them, as they are informed and believe; and
                        could, as they are further informed and believe, have been readily sold for
                        that sum. Your petitioner, <persName>Ann M. Biscoe</persName>, was advised
                        by her friends, after the death of her husband, to rid herself of the
                        trouble of attending them, and to sell them; but they had been brought up in
                        her family, or about her, and under her inspection, and instructed and
                        trained by her, and she was averse to disposing of them in that manner.
                        Since the death of her husband, the wages derived from them, has been both
                        the sole means of support for herself (now 63 years of age) and her family.
                        The value of each of the negroes is stated in the schedule hereto annexed,
                        marked A.M.B. They are all healthy, well-behaved, orderly servants, free
                        from any moral, mental and bodily infirmity or defect, with the exception of
                            <persName>John Bealle</persName>, who is blind in one eye, and who will
                        sometimes, on holidays, indulge and frolic, but not to excess, or the
                        neglect of his work or duties to those with whom he may be hired. It is the
                        same as to drinking a little, with <persName>Ezekiel Biscoe</persName>, who
                        has been a most faithful, diligent and useful servant. They know of no other
                        defect or infirmity in any of them, and believe no other to exist. Such of
                        them as have not been employed in her own family, have been regularly hired
                        out, and have stayed a good while in their places. They were valuable
                        servants.</seg><note type="government" place="foot" xml:id="n3">Here state
                        such facts, if any there be, touching the value of the petitioner's claim to
                        the service or labor of the person, as may enhance the same, and also such
                        facts, if any, touching the moral, mental, and bodily infirmities or defects
                        of said person, as impair the value of the petitioner's claim to such
                        service or labor, and conclude such statement with an averment that the

                        impair the value of petitioner's claim to such service or labor, and that he
                        believes none other to exist. If the petitioner specify no such infirmity or
                        defect, then his statement touching the value of his claim should conclude
                        with an averment that he has no knowledge of any such infirmity or
