                                He was admitted to the <name type="hospital">Annapolis General

                                suffered greatly with vesical irritation. He was transferred to Co.
                                B, 97th New York, and discharged <date type="servicedischarge" when="1865-01-06">January 6,
                                        1865</date>, and pensioned. He returned to his home in <name type="place">New
                                                York</name>, and, on <date type="consult" when="1865-08-06">August 6, 1865</date>, consulted <name type="person">Dr. W.
                                        C. Livingston</name>, who learned from the sergeant that the
                                missile, supposed to be a minié musket ball, had entered at the
                                right inguinal ring, passed through the bladder, and emerged at the
                                middle of the sacrum. Urine dribbled constantly from the anterior
                                wound. He lay under canvas until <date when="1864-06-10">June
                                        10th</date>, when he was sent to hospital at <name type="place">Lynchburg</name>, under the care of Assistant
                                        Surgeon<name type="person">H. C. Chalmers</name>, P. A. C.
                                S.  About <date when="1864-07-01">July 1st</date>, urine began to
                                pass by the urethra. By the middle of September, both openings had
                                closed. Soon afterward he began to experience symptoms of calculus.
                                On <date type="operation" when="1865-08-18">August 18th</date>, <name type="person">Dr. Livingston</name>, assisted by <name type="person">Dr.
                                        Markoe</name> and others, performed the median operation for
                                lithotomy, and removed an oval calculus and two fragments of bone
                                encrusted with calcareous matter. In the course of ten days the
                                urine passed entirely by the urethra, and the patient made a rapid
                                recovery. The fragments of bone were probably chipped off from the
                                pubis, in which a notch could be felt. On sawing the oval calculus,
                                the nucleus was found to consist of a fragment of bone.<note type="authorial" place="footer" xml:id="n1">The later

                                entered just below Poupart's ligament on the right side, passed
                                through the bladder and rectum, and emerged three inches above the
                                anus. In consequence of foreign material remaining in the bladder,
                                vesical calculus formed, which has been removed by median operation.
                                A complete fæcal fistula remains. Disability total, third grade,
                                and permanent. He also has a reducible indirect inguinal hernia, of
