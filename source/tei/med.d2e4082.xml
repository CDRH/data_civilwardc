    <p>  <hi rend="initialcap">C</hi>ASE 151.—<name type="person" key="xxx">Private Philip
      Sweeney</name>, <name type="organization" key="379">Co. C, 3d New York</name>, was wounded in
     the affair at <name type="BATTLE" key="282">Big Bethel</name>, <date type="injury" when="1861-06-10">June 10, 1861</date>, by a conoidal musket ball, which shattered the
     trochanters of the right femur. He was admitted to Hygeia Hospital, <name type="FORT" key="xx">Fort Monroe</name>, on <date type="admit" when="1861-06-13">June 13th</date>, and was treated by <name type="person" key="158">Surgeon
      R. B. Bontecou</name>, <name type="organization" key="132">U. S. V.</name>, by moderate
     extension and dilatation of the wound by sponge tents in order to facilitate the extraction of
     primary <choice><orig>sequestræ</orig><reg>sequestra</reg></choice>, of which many were removed. Suppuration and exfoliation persisted until March, 1862. In <date type="injury" when="1862-04">April</date> there were two severe attacks of erysipelas,
     involving the entire limb, which greatly reduced the patient, but he quickly rallied, and in
     May was able to run a race on crutches with his wounded companions. He was transferred to
     <name type="place">Albany</name> in <date type="transfer" when="1862-06">June, 1862</date>; but his name does not appear
     upon the hospital reports until <date type="admit" when="1863-03">March, 1863</date>, when he was admitted to the Ladies Home, in <name type="place">New York City</name>, where a number of necrosed fragments were
     removed. On <date type="servicedischarge" when="1863-05-25">May 25, 1863</date>, he was discharged, being able to walk without a crutch and
     the limb being but slightly shortened. He soon afterwards engaged himself as a laborer at an
     iron foundry in <name type="place">Troy, New York</name>, where he has since worked without intermission. On <date type="pension" when="1866-07-20">July 20, 1866</date>, he was examined by <name type="person" key="158">Brevet-Colonel R. B. Bontecou</name>, who found him in perfect health, the injured limb a trifle shortened, and the knee rather
     stiff, owing to the destruction of connective tissue about the extensor muscles of the thigh
     during the suppuration following the erysipelatous attacks, and, doubtless, the formation of adhesions. The knee joint was in good condition and had sufficient motion to allow a firm, good gait. In a
     letter dated <date type="pension" when="1868-11-23">November 23, 1868</date>, <name type="person" key="158">Dr. Bontecou</name> states that
     <name type="person" key="xx">Sweeney</name> is at work at <name type="place">Troy</name> in a spike factory, and was
     able to sit at and run a machine. His knee was stiff from agglutination of the sheath of the
     extensor muscles of the thigh, otherwise the limb was useful. The <name type="organization" key="xx">Albany Examining Board</name>, <name type="person" key="xx">Drs. W. Craig</name>,
      <name type="person" key="158">R. B. Bontecou</name>, and <name type="person" key="xx">C. H. Porter</name>, record, in <date type="pension" when="1873-09">September,
       1873</date>: "Gunshot wound through the trochanters, fracturing the femur at the neck, leaving
     adhesions of all the muscles of the thigh from deep-seated sloughing, the result of erysipelas,
     making knee joint stiff in the extended posture." In <date type="pension" when="1875-09">September, 1875</date>, <name type="person" key="158">Examining Surgeon R. B. Bontecou</name> certified that "adhesions have rendered
     the knee immovable and the limb comparatively useless." </p>
