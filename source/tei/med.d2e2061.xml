     "Shot flesh wound of left leg. Patient furloughed <date type="furlough" when="1864-07-29">July
      29th</date>."  <name type="person" key="xx">Assistant Surgeon M. F. Coggswell</name>, <name type="organization" key="132">U. S. V.</name>, in charge of the <name type="place" key="xx">Albany</name> Hospital, reported the following result of the case: "The patient was admitted
      <date type="admit" when="1864-08-01">August 1st</date>, having a large ulcer, measuring six by
     five and a half inches, on the calf of the leg, the result of a gunshot wound. His general
     health was very poor, and he was anæmic and debilitated. Gangrene had appeared previous to
     his admission to this hospital, and the ulcer was indolent, foul, and unhealthy. Nitrate of
     silver was applied and solution of chlorinate of soda, also poultices of flaxseed-meal mingled
     with pulverized charcoal. This treatment was followed in twenty-four hours by a healthy
     discharge of pus and a general improvement of the ulcer. Beef-tea, milk-punch, and extra diet were ordered. On the 2d of August
     his tongue was red and dry, his appetite failed, and he manifested great uneasiness and
     appeared to labor under an impression of impending evil. That night (August 2d) the weather,
     which had been very hot and dry for several days, suddenly became damp and chilly, and on the
     morning of <date type="death" when="1864-08-03">August 3d</date>, at 4 o'clock, symptoms of trismus appeared, and were followed in two
     hours by a general spasm of all the voluntary muscles. The <hi rend="italic">risus sardonicus</hi> was marked, and the patient was in great distress; deglutition was impossible.
     Beef-essence and milk-punch were administered by enemata, and half a grain of sulphate of
     morphia was injected hypodermically over the epigastrium. The latter acted so speedily and powerfully that in two hours
     all the muscles were relaxed. The patient's strength, however, was completely exhausted, and at
     8 o'clock P. M. he expired, there being no recurrence of the tetanic symptoms.  No general <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> was made; a local examination did not reveal anything. The
     trunk of the posterior tibial nerve was intact, but its muscular and cutaneous branches were involved."</p>
