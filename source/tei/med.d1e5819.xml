                                        attack of typhoid fever. <hi rend="italic">Post-mortem</hi>
                                        examination twenty-four hours after death: Slight cadaveric
                                        rigidity: much bloody froth issuing from the mouth and
                                        nostrils. The mucous lining of the stomach was irregularly
                                        colored; it was of a slaty hue at the pylorus, mottled
                                        reddish and blackish. Beneath the epithelial lining of the
                                        duodenum a quantity of gas was found, supposed to be due to
                                        putrefactive changes. Below this point the mucous membrane
                                        was of a dull whitish color, very inelastic and easily torn.
                                        Eight feet from the ileo-cæecal valve Peyer's
                                        patches commenced to be involved; at first the upper and
                                        lower parts of the patch were swollen, livid, not ulcerated,
                                        the centre being natural; lower down some were entirely
                                        livid, with no ulceration; about one foot from the valve was
                                        one very large patch with thick high walls, ulcerated centre
                                        and numerous small ulcerated points in its area. These
                                        portions were of a lighter hue than the non-ulcerated
                                        portions, but none of them perforated the gut; the largest
                                        patches gave the intestine a honey-combed appearance from
                                        the peculiarity of the ulceration. The large intestine was
                                        of a grayish-slate color, its mucous membrane softned but
                                        not ulcerated.—<hi rend="italic"><name type="person" key="245">Ass't Surg. Harrison
