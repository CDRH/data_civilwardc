    Hospital of the Second Corps, and <name type="person" key="xxx">Acting Staff Surgeon J.

    sent on to <name type="place" key="#Washington">Washington</name>, where he was received into
     <name type="hospital" key="173">Harewood Hospital</name> on <date type="transfer" when="1865-04-04">April 4th</date>. <name type="person" key="158">Surgeon R. B.
    Bontecou</name>, <name type="organization" key="132">U. S. V.</name>, reported: "Gunshot
    wound of the left shoulder and back, the ball entering at the head of the humerus and making its
    exit near the anterior portion of the scapula, fracturing the head of the humerus and the
    acromion process. On <date type="operation" when="1865-04-22">April 22d</date>, the wound being
    in a suppurating condition, the patient was placed under the influence of ether, and the head
    and about four inches of the shaft of the humerus were removed. The after-treatment was
    supporting, with simple dressings, and the result was favorable." The photograph represented
    in the cut (<hi rend="initialcap">F</hi>IG. 451) was taken while the patient was at Harewood
    Hospital, and was contributed to <name type="hospital" key="431">the Museum</name> by the
    operator, <name type="person" key="158">Dr. Bontecou</name>. This soldier was discharged from

     <name type="person" key="xxx">Examiner J. S. Delevan</name>, of <name type="place">Albany</name>, reported, <date type="pension" when="1866-09-08">September 8, 1866</date>:
    "Ball entered the left shoulder. The shoulder joint was resected, with a portion of the
    humerus. The limb cannot he used at all, excepting that the hand can be opened and shut, but he
    cannot carry anything in it. The elbow joint cannot be bent fully, and for all practical
    purposes it is useless to him, and in my opinion permanently so; disability total." <name type="person" key="xxx">Dr. P. F. L. Reynolds</name>, of <name type="place">Albany</name>,
    certified as follows: "Said <name type="person" key="xxx">John Ruddy</name> died at <name type="place">Albany</name>, <date type="death" when="1868-06-03">June 3, 1868</date>, from the
    effects of a gunshot wound; the ball which occasioned it having passed through the upper lobe of
    the left lung and out of the left shoulder, resulting in the wasting away of his system, and was
    the sole cause of his death."</p>
