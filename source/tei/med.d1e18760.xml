                lung and the lower lobe of the right were found to be very much congested. There was some effusion on the right side. The
                pathological specimen is No. 4082, Section I, A. M. M., and was contributed, with the history of the case, by <name type="person">Acting Assistant Surgeon J. P. Arthur</name>.  </p>
