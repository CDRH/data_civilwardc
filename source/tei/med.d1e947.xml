                                        nineteen hours after death: Body emaciated; rigor mortis
                                        marked; suggillation posteriorly; muco-puruleut matter
                                        escaping from nostrils; large but superficial abscess in
                                        perinæum. The pharynx and æsophagus were
                                        normal. The larynx and trachea were filled with
                                        muco-purulent matter, but the mucous membrane was healthy.
                                        The right lung was adherent to the thoracic parietes by
                                        recent lymph; its posterior portions were infiltrated with
                                        pus. The left lung, heart and pericardium were healthy. The
                                        liver was darker in color than usual, but was otherwise
                                        healthy; the gall-bladder contained six drachms of bile. The
                                        spleen, pancreas and kidneys were normal, as were also the
                                        stomach and the greater portion of the small intestine. The
                                        lower part of the ileum presented three or four ulcers which
                                        appeared to be in Peyer's patches; but the patches were not
                                        thickened and the ulcers seemed to be healing. The colon and
                                        rectum were normal.—<hi rend="italic"><name type="person" key="xxx">Act. Ass't Surg. Thomas Bowen</name>,
