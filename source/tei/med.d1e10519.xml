                                        having been sick for <date type="injury" when="1865-01-29">five days</date>.  The disease commenced with a
                                        chill which lasted an hour and was followed by severe lumbar
                                        pain. On admission he had no headache, but pain in the loins
                                        was very distressing; he was restless and had a wild
                                        expression, a moist and coated tongue, full and rapid pulse,
                                        coryza, cough and some oppression of the chest; a dark rash,
                                        which disappeared on pressure, was noticed on the surface.
                                        Rochelle salt and morphia were administered and dry cups
                                        applied, but in the evening he was no better. He was
                                        restless during the night.  <date type="death" when="1865-02-04">Next day</date> the dark rash covered
                                        the whole of the body; the patient was drowsy, his pupils
                                        contracted; abdomen tympanitic; respiration difficult.  He
                                        died comatose before midday.  <hi rend="italic">Post-mortem</hi>
                                        examination: Chest, abdomen and posterior aspect of
                                        extremities covered with a dark-purple rash and petechial
                                        spots; face presenting purpuric patches but no
                                        petechiæ. The blood throughout the body was thin.
                                        The veins of the cerebral and spinal membranes were engorged
                                        and there was serum beneath the arachnoid; but the substance
                                        of the brain and cord was healthy. Ecchymosed spots were
                                        found on the parietal pleura and serum tinged with blood in
                                        each pleural sac, but the lungs were healthy. The
                                        peritoneum, mesentery, stomach and intestines were covered
                                        with scarlet and dark-red petechial spots. The liver weighed
                                        one hundred and sixteen ounces; the gall-bladder was large
                                        and full. The right kidney weighed eleven ounces, the left
                                        ten ounces; their capsules and the surrounding connective
                                        tissue were ecchymosed.—<hi rend="italic"><name type="hospital" key="162">Douglas Hospital</name>,
