                near and external to the left frontal eminence, slightly depressing the external and
                fissuring the internal table. He was admitted to the hospital of the 2d division,
                Second Army Corps, and on <date type="transfer" when="1863-10-19">October
                    19th</date> was sent to <name type="hospital" key="176">Lincoln Hospital</name>,
                Washington. No cerebral symptoms existed for some time after admission. On <date type="operation" when="1863-11-06">November 6th</date>, hæmorrhage, which
                was arrested by ligation, occurred from the anterior temporal artery.
                Hæmorrhage recurred on November 20th, and on the following day the wound became
                gangrenous. The patient grew comatose and died on <date type="death" when="1863-11-29">November 29th, 1863</date>. At the autopsy the external table
                was found necrosed, the diploë was filled with fungous granulations. The dura
                mater was indurated beneath the injured spot, although no evidences of inflammation
                were present. On removing the brain a large quantity of thin pale serum was found in
                the subarachnoid space. A large abscess existed in the anterior of the left
                hemisphere just beneath the seat of injury, extending into the lateral ventricle,
                filled with thick, sanious and fœtid pus. The right ventricle was normal. The
                pathological specimen is figured in the cut (<hi rend="initialcap">F</hi>IG. 69.)
                The inner table of the cranium presents a T-shaped fissure without depression, and
                is spongy. A thin plate of bone one inch in diameter is necrosed on the external
                table, and the adjacent osseous tissue is porous and cribriform. The specimen was
