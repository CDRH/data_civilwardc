                <p>To the Commissioners under the act of Congress approved the <date when="1862-04-16">16th of April 1862</date>, entitled An act for the release
                    of certain persons held to service or labor in the <placeName>District of
                        Columbia</placeName>.</p>

                <p>Your Petitioner <persName>Martha E. Nixon</persName> by this her petition in
                    writing represents and states that she is a person loyal to the
                        <placeName>United States</placeName>, who at the time of the passage of the
                    said act of Congress held a claim to service or labor against <persName>Isaiah
                        Carter</persName> person of African descent, for and during the term of
                    Eighteen (18) years of the life of the said <persName>Isaiah Carter</persName>;
                    and that by said act of Congress said <persName>Isaiah Carter</persName> was
                    discharged and freed of and from all claim of your petitioner to such service or
                    labor; that the time of said discharge said <persName>Isaiah Carter</persName>
                    was of the age of three years and of the personal description following: dark
                    brown color, regular features, about three feet high.</p>


                <p>That your petitioner acquired her claim to the aforesaid service or labor of said
                        <persName>Isaiah Carter</persName> in manner following: One <persName>Eliza
                        Carter</persName>, the mother of said <persName>Isaiah Carter</persName>,
                    was an African woman by <choice><sic>decent</sic><corr>descent</corr></choice> and an indolent trifling character; abandoned her said son
                        <persName>Isaiah Carter</persName>, at the house of your petitioner at the
                    age of six months, and refused to <pb xml:id="leaf001v" facs="cww.00895.002.jpg"/> take any care of the said <persName>Isaiah Carter</persName>; but the said
                        <persName>Eliza Carter</persName> instead of taking her said son so left
                    with your petitioner went before the proper authorities of the
                        <placeName>District of Columbia</placeName>, and by indenture in writing
                    bound, the said <persName>Isaiah Carter</persName>, then six months of age to
                    your petitioner until he said <persName>Isaiah Carter</persName> should become
                    of the age of Twenty-one years, and your petitioner has nurtured and provided
                    for the comfort of the said <persName>Isaiah</persName> for the term of Two
                    years and six months with the expectation and hope of being repaid her trouble
                    and <choice><sic>expence</sic><corr>expense</corr></choice> when the said <persName>Isaiah Carter</persName> should arrive at the
                    physical strength of manhood, of which he is now freed by the said act of
                    Congress.</p>

                <p>Your petitioner's claim to the service &amp; labor of the said <persName>Isaiah
                        Carter</persName> was at the time of said discharge therefrom, of the value
                    of seven hundred dollars in money ($700.00)</p>

                <p>Your petitioner hereby declares that she bears true and faithful allegiance to
                    the Government of the <placeName>United States</placeName> and that she has not
                    borne arms against the <placeName>United States</placeName> in the present
                    rebellion nor in any way given aid or comfort thereto.</p>

                <p>And your petitioner further states and alleges that she has not brought said
                        <persName>Isaiah Carter</persName> into the <placeName>District of
                        Columbia</placeName><pb xml:id="leaf002r" facs="cww.00895.003.jpg"/> since the passage of said act of
                    Congress, and at the time of the passage thereof; said <persName>Isaiah
                        Carter</persName> was held to service or labor therein under and by virtue
                    of your petitioner's claim to such service or labor.</p>

                <p>Your petitioner further states and alleges that her said claim to the service and
                    labor of said <persName>Isaiah Carter</persName>, does
                    not originate in or by virtue of any transfer heretofore made by any person who
                    has in any manner aided or sustained the present rebellion against the
                    Government of the <placeName>United States</placeName>.</p>

                <p>And your petitioner prays the said Commissioners to investigate and determine the
                    validity of her said claim to the service and labor
                    of said <persName>Isaiah Carter</persName> herein above
                    set forth and if the same be found to be valid, that they appraise and
                    apportion the value of said claim in money and report the same to the Secretary
                    of the Treasury of the <placeName>United States</placeName> in conformity to
                    the provisions of said Act of Congress.</p>
