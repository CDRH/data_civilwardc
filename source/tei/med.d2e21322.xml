      Fox</name>, <name type="organization" key="221">Co. I, 111th New York</name>, aged 18 years,
     was wounded in the right foot during the engagement at the <name type="BATTLE" key="283">South Side Railroad</name>, <date type="injury" when="1865-03-31">March 31, 1865</date>. He was
     admitted to <name type="hospital" key="173">Harewood Hospital</name>, Washington, <date type="admit" when="1865-04-05">five days afterwards</date>, where amputation was performed by <name type="person" key="158">Surgeon R. B.
      Bontecou</name>, <name type="organization" key="132">U. S. V.</name>, who made the following
     report:  "The metatarsal bone of the big toe was fractured and the os calcis severely injured.
     When admitted the patient appeared to be considerably debilitated; the condition of the injured
     parts, however, was tolerably good. The parts subsequently became gangrenous, with
     disorganization of the ankle joint, sloughing of soft parts, and necrosis of bone. Sinuses
     formed and extended up the leg. The limb was amputated at the lower third by the circular
     method on <date type="operation" when="1865-05-03">May 3d</date>. The patient did well after the operation under simple dressings, aided by a
     supporting and nourishing diet throughout. The parts had nearly healed when he was transferred
     to <name type="hospital" key="171">Armory Square Hospital</name> <date type="transfer" when="1865-07-20">July 20th</date>."  <date type="transfer" when="1865-08">About one month
     later</date> he was transferred to <name type="hospital" key="175">Stanton Hospital</name>, where a
     second operation became necessary and was performed by <name type="person" key="405">Surgeon
      B. B. Wilson</name>, <name type="organization" key="132">U. S. V.</name>, who describes it as
     follows:  "The first amputation had been performed about one inch above the ankle joint. At the
     time of the patient's admission to <name type="hospital" key="175">Stanton Hospital</name> the
     stump had entirely healed, but it was swollen and painful and presented evidence of suppurative
     inflammation within. Poultices were applied and abscesses soon pointed in two or three places,
     one in or near the cicatrix of the operation and the other along the lower part of the shaft of
     the tibia, which, on rupturing, discharged a bloody and ill-conditioned pus pretty freely. Upon
     examination with a probe the existence of necrosed bone was detected, and at the earnest
     request of the patient, who desired to get rid of his trouble as quickly and fully as possible,
     it was determined to re-amputate the stump as far as the sequestrum extended. The operation was
     performed on <date type="operation" when="1865-09-06">September 6th</date>, three inches of the bones being removed by the ordinary circular
     method and the sequestrum found to extend quite up to the point severed by the saw. The
     integument was brought together laterally and secured by interrupted sutures and adhesive
     straps. The patient did well and the healing process progressed rapidly. At the closing of
     <name type="hospital" key="175">Stanton Hospital</name>, on <date type="transfer" when="1865-09-19">September 19th</date>, he was sent to
      <name type="hospital" key="162">Douglas Hospital</name>, where I saw him two weeks afterwards,
     when the stump was almost entirely healed and looked admirably."  In <date type="servicedischarge" when="1865-10">October, 1865</date>, the patient was discharged from service, to date from
     <date type="servicedischarge" when="1865-09-06">September 6th</date>, and pensioned, having been previously supplied with an artificial leg. In his applications for commutation he described the stump as being in "sound" and "good condition." His
     pension was paid <date type="pension" when="1880-09-04">September 4,1880</date>. The bones removed at the second amputation were contributed
     to <name type="hospital" key="431">the Museum</name> by <name type="person" key="405">the operator</name> and constitute specimen
     2454 of the Surgical Section, exhibiting the fibula in a state of caries and a large spongy
     involucrum surrounding a small sequestrum of the tibia. </p>
