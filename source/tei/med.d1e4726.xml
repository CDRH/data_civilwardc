          he was wakeful and suffering from headache, his countenance anxious, eyes dull, cheeks
          flushed, pulse 100 and thread-like, skin about the natural temperature, tongue red and
          moist at the tip and edges, dry and coated yellow in the centre, appetite lost and bowels
          loose and tympanitic; he had some cough with whitish expectoration. One drachm of sweet
          spirit of nitre was given every hour. Small doses of blue-pill and opium were prescribed
          on the 9th and repeated on the 10th and 11th, with twelve grains of quinine each day, and
          with eight grains on the 12th, on which day beef-essence and emulsion of turpentine were
          also administered. The tongue, however, remained coated yellowish-white and the appetite
          poor up to the 19th, when the last notes were entered on the record. The patient was
          transferred to <name type="place">Baltimore, Md.</name>, <date type="transfer" when="1861-12-03">December 3</date>. </p>
