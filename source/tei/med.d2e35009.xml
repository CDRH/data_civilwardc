    <date type="admit" when="1863-01-18">Jan. 18, 1863</date>, having been sick two weeks. He spoke of
    having hurt his back and ruptured himself by a fall while on the march, and complained of pain in
    his back. Symptoms of what was supposed to be pericarditis made their appearance on February 7, and
    next day veratrum viride was prescribed. On the 11th he was noticed to be very deaf; his pulse was
    slow and weak, and vomiting had set in. The veratrum viride was discontinued. Next day he lapsed
    into stupor and when aroused with difficulty from this state his answers were incoherent; his
    breathing was rapid. On the 11th an eruption like that of typhoid fever made its appearance on his
    body and extremities; he coughed much and muttered to himself; there appeared to be some iliac
    tenderness; his urine required to be drawn off by catheter. Next day his evacuations became
    involuntary. He died on the <date type="death" when="1863-02-19">19th</date>. <hi rend="italic">Post-mortem</hi> examination four hours after death: Body emaciated; rigor mortis marked. The brain
    weighed forty-six ounces; it was light-colored, of firm consistence and contained much fluid in its
    ventricles. The heart was healthy. The right lung weighed fifteen ounces, the left thirteen ounces;
    the right was full of blood, the upper lobe being somewhat congested and the lower universally so;
    the upper lobe of the left lung was congested; collapsed lobules were observed in the lower lobes of
    both lungs; the bronchial tubes were congested and some of the smaller ones contained pus. The liver
    weighed fifty-four ounces and was universally congested; the gall-bladder contained eleven drachms
    of dark-green bile; the spleen weighed five ounces and a half and was of a dark-slate color
    externally, dark-red internally and moderately firm in consistence; the kidneys weighed four ounces
    and a half each and were of a rather dark color; the stomach was slightly congested. The mucous
    membrane of the small intestine was softened, especially near the ileo-cæcal valve; it was
    slightly congested in the jejunum and upper third of the ileum, decidedly so in the lower two-thirds
    of the ileum, where a number of ulcers were observed. The cæcum was of a dark-slate color; the
    rest of the large intestine was normal. The mesenteric and mesocolic glands were enlarged,
    especially the latter.—<hi rend="italic"><name type="person" key="244">Ass't Surg. George M.
