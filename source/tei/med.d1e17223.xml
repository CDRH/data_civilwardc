                                                  thickened and adherent to the brain. The brain
                                                  itself was hardened and pale, except in the
                                                  vicinity of the wound, where it was of a rich

                                                  had lodged at a depth of one and a half inches in
                                                  the right posterior occipital lobe, a little below
