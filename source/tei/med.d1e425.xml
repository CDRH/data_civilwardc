                                                Inf.</name>; age 32; was admitted <date type="admit" when="1865-10-20">October 20, 1865</date>, having
                                        been sick five weeks, first with diarrhœa for two
                                        weeks and afterwards with chills and fever. He had a chill
                                        daily at 3.30 P. M., for which five grains of quinine were
                                        ordered at 8, 10, 12 and 2 o'clock. During the paroxysms the
                                        patient's intellect was clouded and his replies delayed; he
                                        fainted on sitting up; passed his urine involuntarily; had
                                        pain in the head, back and limbs; the heart's action was
                                        tumultuous; the pulse too rapid to count, and most frequent
                                        at the commencement of the sweating. Some roughness of the
                                        heart-sounds were observed. The tongue was coated, dry
                                        during fever, moist at other times; the bowels were open. On <date when="1865-10-22">the 22d</date> the quinine was repeated, but the chill and fever
                                        recurred in a more aggravated form. The patient was very
                                        weak; had sordes on his teeth; pulse scarcely perceptible at
                                        the wrist; urination involuntary. Whiskey was given and
                                        mustard applied to the epigastrium. <date type="death" when="1865-10-23">Next day</date> he had hiccough,
                                        stertor, profuse sweats, vomiting of small blood-clots,
                                        dysphagia, insensible pupils and involuntary passages;
                                        crepitation was heard over the lower part of the left side
                                        of the chest. He died at 2.30 P. M.  <hi rend="italic">Post-mortem</hi> examination twenty hours after
                                        death: Right arm flexed and rigid; left arm flaccid. There
                                        was a quantity of serum in the ventricles of the brain; the
                                        brain-substance was of a darker ash color than usual, and
                                        sections presented many points of black engorged vessels.
                                        The right lung was healthy; the lower lobe of the left lung
                                        much congested, nearly hepatized. The pericardium contained
                                        three ounces and a third of light-pink serum; the apex of
                                        the heart adhered to the pericardium by a lymph-patch the
                                        size of a shelled almond; the right ventricle of the heart
                                        was unusually flaccid, the mitral valve thickened and of a
                                        dull yellow color. The omentum was thin and dark lead color.
                                        The liver weighed eighty-five ounces; it was of a dull slate
                                        color. The spleen was pulpy, weighed twenty ounces and a
                                        half. Some patches of congestion were observed in the ileum.
                                        The kidneys were large but healthy.—<hi rend="italic"><name type="hospital" key="162">Douglas Hospital</name>, <name type="place">Washington, D. C.</name></hi></p>
