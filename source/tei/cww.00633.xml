                <p>Your Petitioner hereby declares that she bears true &amp; faithful allegiance to
                    the Government of the <placeName>United States</placeName>, &amp; that she has

                        <persName>Mary Butler</persName> into the <placeName>District of

                        States</placeName></p>

                <p>And your Petitioner prays the said Commissioners will <pb xml:id="leaf002r" facs="cww.00633.003.jpg"/> investigate &amp; determine the Validity of her said Claim to the service of said <persName>Catharine</persName>,
