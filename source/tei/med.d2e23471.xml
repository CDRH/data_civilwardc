     Elderkin</name>, <name type="organization" key="96">Co. C, 6th Maine</name>, aged 24 years, was
    wounded at <name type="BATTLE" key="15">Rappahannock Station</name>, <date type="injury" when="1863-11-07">November 7, 1863</date>, by a minié ball, which entered the dorsum of
    the right foot, fracturing the metatarsal bones, and making its exit at the plantar surface.
     <date type="admit" when="1863-11-09">Two days afterwards</date> he was admitted to <name type="hospital" key="173">Harewood Hospital</name> at Washington, where the wound became
    gangrenous about November 23d. For this a local treatment of nitric acid and oakum dressing was
    applied and a constitutional treatment of tonics, stimulants, and beef tea diet was
    administered. The disease, however, not being arrested and the patient growing weaker, operative
    interference became necessary, and Pirogoff's amputation was performed on <date type="operation" when="1863-12-06">December 6th</date> by <name type="person" key="158">Surgeon R. B.
     Bontecou</name>, <name type="organization" key="132">U. S. V.</name> After the operation the
    parts were kept properly adjusted and the supporting treatment was continued. About January 4,
    1864, the progress of the case was interrupted by erysipelas making its appearance, followed by
    sloughing of the soft parts to some extent. Tincture of chloride of iron was then prescribed and
    wheat flour was applied locally. The inflammation was arrested in about two weeks, after which
    the patient's health improved daily and the wound healed rapidly. He was discharged from service
    with a useful stump <date type="servicedischarge" when="1864-04-23">April 23, 1864</date>, and
    pensioned. The amputated part of the foot (<hi rend="italic">Spec</hi>. 2028), contributed with
    the history by <name type="person" key="158">the operator</name>, is represented in the annexed
    cut (<hi rend="initialcap">F</hi>IG. 349), and shows the metatarsus to have been badly
    shattered, some of the fragments being necrosed and a slight effusion of callus having occurred
    in the neighboring parts. After receiving his discharge the patient was supplied with a "Palmer"
    artificial foot, which, however, did not prove satisfactory, and is reported to have become
    entirely useless in about two months. The pensioner died <date type="death" when="1866-12-14">December 14, 1866</date>, his physician, <name type="person" key="xx">Dr. A. G.
    Peabody</name>, of <name type="place" key="xx">Machias, Maine</name>, certifying that "death was
    caused by consumption arising from hardship, exposure, and the loss of the foot, the amputated
    foot leaving a stump which never thoroughly healed, but remained a constant drain upon the vital
    powers of the man's constitution."</p>
