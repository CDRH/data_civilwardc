                    <seg type="handwritten">or thereabouts, according to the prices which had been
                        paid in cash for similar negroes by those dealing in them, as she is
                        informed and believes; but as many of them were old family servants, or the
                        descendants of such, and had been brought up in her and her husband's and
                        parent's families, and her own since their deaths, and were well-behaved and
                        orderly servants, she was averse to making such a disposition of them. The
                        value of each, according to her estimate and belief, is stated in said
                        schedule hereto annexed. Leaving out for the present those on said list,
                        marked Nos. 4, 9, 12, 16, 18, 21, 25 and 30, to be spoken of hereafter, all
                        the others, named in said list, are strong, healthy, and honest negroes, and
                        free from any moral, mental or bodily infirmity or defect. As to the others,
                        and their infirmities and defects, she states, that <persName>Susan
                            Carroll</persName> (No. 4) and <persName>Mary Brown</persName> (No. 25)
                        are delicate and cannot bear outdoor work and exposure. <persName>Chapman
                            Toyer</persName> (No. 9) broke his leg, but is entirely recovered, and
                        can work as well as before the accident. <persName>Kitty Silass</persName>
                        (No. 12) is rather deaf. <persName>Saml Yates</persName> (No. 16) is
                        deformed, having a curved spine. <persName>John Thomas</persName> (No. 18)
                        had three fingers of his left hand injured by a corn sheller, and lost two
                        joints of his little finger, one joint of his third finger, and his second
                        finger stiffened; but he can drive the Carriage and work as well as before.
                            <persName>Louisa Toyer</persName> (No. 21) was sickly about nine months
                        ago, but is well and healthy now. <persName>Mortimer Briscoe</persName> (No.
                        30) had one of his toes frost bitten, but is otherwise sound.
                            <persName>Richd. Williams</persName> (No. 8) <persName>John
                            Thomas</persName> (No. 18) and <persName>Resin Yates</persName> (No. 32)
                        on two occasions were concerned in taking some meat from the meat house and
                        some chickens. These three are remarkably strong healthy, and capable
                        negroes. And as to them, and all the others, your petitioner knows of no
                        other infirmity or defect, moral, mental or bodily, except such as are
                        named, and believes no other to exist. Some of these defects are slight, and
                        do not materially impair the value or usefulness of the negro. Some of them
                        have been employed in her own family as servants, as marked on the list, and
                        for these wages could not be stated. The others have been hired out, and
                        have usually stayed at their places, and have brought good wages, the rate
                        being stated in said list. They were valuable servants. The occurrence as to
                        the meat and chickens was about nine years ago. Since then they have been
                        quite correct; but she deemed it right to name every thing.</seg>

                <p>Your petitioner hereby declares that <seg type="handwritten">she</seg> bears true

                <p>And your petitioner further states and alleges, that <seg type="handwritten">she</seg> has not brought said <seg type="handwritten">persons</seg> into

                <p>Your petitioner further states and alleges, that <seg type="handwritten">her</seg> said claim to the service or labor of said <seg type="handwritten">persons</seg> does not originate in or by virtue of any

                    the present rebellion against the Government of the United States.</p>

                <p>And your petitioner prays the said Commissioners to investigate and determine the
                    validity of <seg type="handwritten">her</seg> said claim to the service or labor
                    of said <seg type="handwritten">persons</seg> herein above set forth; and if the
                    same be found to be valid, that they appraise and apportion the value of said
                    claim in money, and report the same to the Secretary of the Treasury of the
                    United States, in conformity to the provisions of said act of Congress.</p>
