   <p>The chromo-lithograph represents this very common condition, in which the pigment deposits
    remaining after former attacks complicated the appearances of the more recent process. The
    specimen was obtained from an autopsy made at the <name type="hospital" key="428">Judiciary
     Square hospital</name>l, Washington, D. C., <name type="person" key="xxx">Assistant Surgeon E.
     J. Marsh</name>, <name type="organization" key="190">U. S. A.</name>, surgeon in charge, and
    was brought immediately to <name type="hospital" key="431">the Museum</name>, where the
    water-color drawing reproduced in the plate was made by <name type="person" key="xxx">Mr. H.
     Faber</name>. The following very brief history of the case was furnished:</p>
   <p><hi rend="initialcap">C</hi>ASE 879.—<name type="person" key="xxx">Private Henry M.
     Pierce</name>, <name type="organization" key="xxx">company K, 25th Maine volunteers</name>, was
    taken sick while with his regiment near <name type="place">Chantilly, Virginia</name>,<date type="injury" when="1863-03-23"> March 23, 1863</date>. The diagnosis on the regimental
    register is simply "fever." Continuing to grow worse, he was sent to <name type="place" key="#Washington">Washington</name> and was admitted to <name type="hospital" key="428">Judiciary Square hospital</name>, <date type="admit" when="1863-04-13">April 13, 1863</date>.
    Diagnosis, remittent fever. The febrile symptoms were accompanied by diarrhœa, from which
    he had previously suffered several times. He did well under treatment, and was apparently
    convalescing, though the diarrhœa still continued to the extent of several stools a day,
    when pneumonia supervened and was the cause of death, <date type="death" when="1863-05-11">May
     11th</date>. <hi rend="italic">Autopsy:</hi> The lower portion of both lungs was hepatized. The
    greater part of the ileum presented the conditions exhibited by the specimen. The mucous
    membrane of the colon was darkly reddened, but no marked enlargement of the solitary glands of
    the colon was noticed.</p>
