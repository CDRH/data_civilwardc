                    petitioner's claim to the service or labor of said <persName>Mary
                        Ellen</persName> and her said children was, at the time of said discharge

                <pb xml:id="leaf001v" facs="cww.00830.002.jpg"/>

                <p>Your petitioner hereby declares that she bears true and faithful allegiance to
                    the government of the <placeName>United States</placeName>, and that she has not
                    borne arms against the <placeName>United States</placeName> in the present
                    rebellion, nor in any way given aid or comfort thereto:</p>

                <p>And your petitioner further states &amp; alleges that she has not brought said
                        <persName>Mary Ellen</persName> and her said children, into the
                        <placeName>District of Columbia</placeName> since the passage of said Act of

                        Ellen</persName> and her said children were held to service or labor therein
                    under and by virtue of your petitioner's claim to such service or labor.</p>

                <p>Your petitioner further states &amp; alleges that her said claim to the service
                    or labor of said <persName>Mary Ellen</persName> and her said children, does not
                    originate in or by virtue of any transfer heretofore made by any person who has
                    in any manner aided or sustained the present rebellion against the government of
                    the <placeName>United States</placeName>.</p>

                <p>And your petitioner prays the said Commissioners to investigate and determine the
                    validity of her said claim to the service or labor of the said <persName>Mary
                        Ellen</persName> and her said children herein above set forth; and if the
                    same be found to be valid, that they appraise and apportion the value of said
                    claim in money and report the same to the Secretary of the Treasury of the
                        <placeName>United States</placeName>, in conformity to the provisions of
                    said Act of Congress.</p>
