                                        larynx were inflamed; the soft palate hard, stiff and white;
                                        the tonsils unaffected; between the pharynx and right
                                        arytenoid cartilage was a large abscess with hard,
                                        yellowish-white walls; the cartilage mentioned was the seat
                                        of a protuberance, probably a collection of pus; there was
                                        also a small abscess immediately above the left greater
                                        cornu of the hyoid bone; the vocal chords and the upper
                                        surface of the epiglottis were œdematous. The
                                        pericardium contained seventeen drachms of yellowish fluid;
                                        the heart was very soft. The liver was bronzed and mottled
                                        with hard lardaceous spots, the gall-bladder full of
                                        dark-brown viscid bile; the spleen was rather small and
                                        extremely soft; the pancreas soft and of a dull-red color;
                                        the kidneys congested. In the ileum the villi were very
                                        soft; Peyer's patches were not raised, but one of them
                                        presented an ulcer with low rounded edges, at the base of
                                        which the transverse muscular fibres could be seen; the
                                        ileum had the ironed-out appearance. The colon was
                                        slate-colored, its solitary follicles whitish, with
                                        conspicuous dark-spotted centres.—<hi rend="italic"><name type="person" key="245">Ass't
