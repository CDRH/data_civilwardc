                                    was wounded at <name type="battle">Chickahominy River, Virginia</name>, <date type="injury" when="1864-06-02">June 2d, 1864</date>, by a conoidal ball, which struck the
                                                  left clavicle about its middle, producing a
                                                  comminuted fracture, passed downward and backward,
                                                  and lodged apparently beneath the scapula. He was
                                                  admitted to <name type="hospital" key="175">Stanton Hospital</name>, Washington, on <date type="admit" when="1864-06-04">June 4th</date>. The wound was suppurating profusely but
                                                  of good quality; the broken ends of the clavicle
                                                  over lapping each other; they were denuded of
                                                  periosteum and bathed with pus; they were
                                                  surrounded by a cavity filled with pus, which
                                                  extended down almost to the artery, and there was
                                                  great danger that the sharp end of the underlying
                                                  fragment would be driven into the artery by an
                                                  unlucky movement of the elbow. The general health
                                                  of the patient was favorable. On <date type="operation" when="1864-06-13">June 13th, 1864</date>,
                                                  ether was administered, the wound of entrance
                                                  dilated by an incision on the front of the
                                                  clavicle, and two inches of its middle third
                                                  excised with a chain saw and the osteotome, great
                                                  care being taken that the subclavian artery should
                                                  receive no detriment. The portion resected was
                                                  denuded of periosteum and lying in a cavity filled
                                                  with pus. Death occurred from pleuritis on <date type="death" when="1864-06-23">June
                                                  23d, 1864</date>. The case is reported by the operator, <name type="person" key="70">Surgeon John A. Lidell</name>, <name type="organization" key="132">U. S. V.</name> </p>
