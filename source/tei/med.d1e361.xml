                                debility induced by malarial disease. He had severe neuralgic pain
                                in the back and limbs; his feet and legs frequently became very much
                                swollen, which condition, as it could be traced to no marked lesion
                                of the viscera, was referred to weakness of the circulation and
                                anæmia. The treatment consisted of a general alterative and
                                supporting course. Iodide of potassium, iron in various forms,
                                vegetable bitters, mineral acids, stimulants, counter-irritation and
                                anodynes were employed in accordance with the indications. No
                                improvement, however, was apparent; in fact he seemed to decline.
                                After remaining in hospital three and a half months he was
                                discharged from the service <date type="servicedischarge" when="1864-12-16">December 16, 1864</date>.—<hi rend="italic">Hospital, <name type="place">Alexandria
