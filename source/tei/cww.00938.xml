                    are discharged &amp; freed of and from all claim of your petitioner to such
                    service &amp; labor; that at the time of the said discharge said <persName>George

                    money.</p>

                <p>Your petitioner hereby declares that he bears true &amp; faithful allegiance to the
                    government of the <placeName>United States</placeName>, &amp; that he has not
                    borne arms against the <placeName>United States</placeName> in the present
                    rebellion, nor in any way given aid or comfort thereto.</p>

                <p>And your petitioner further states and alleges that he has not brought said
                        <persName>George Quander</persName> &amp; <persName>Ned Quander</persName>
                    into the <placeName>District of Columbia</placeName> since the passage of the said
                    Act of Congress; and that, at the time of the passage thereof, said

                    claim for himself &amp; his coheirs to such service or labor.</p>

                <p>Your petitioner further states and alleges, that his said claim to the service or
                    labor of the said <persName>George Quander</persName> <persName>Ned
                        Quander</persName> does not originate in or by virtue of any transfer

                    present rebellion against the government of the <placeName>United
                        States</placeName>.</p>

                <p>And your petitioner, for himself and his coheirs, prays the said Commissioners to
                    investigate and determine the validity of their said claim to the service &amp;
                    labor of the said <persName>George Quander</persName> &amp; <persName>Ned
