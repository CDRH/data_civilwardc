          Belt</name>, <name type="organization" key="xxx">Co. C, 155th Pennsylvania
          Volunteers</name>, having been wounded at <name type="BATTLE" key="xxx">Petersburg</name>
        on <date type="injury" when="1865-03-25">March 25th</date>, was admitted to <name type="hospital" key="171">Armory Square Hospital</name>, Washington, on <date type="admit" when="1865-04-24">April 24th, 1865</date>. A bullet had entered through the cartilaginous
        portion of the seventh rib, passed into the region of the transverse colon, and lodged. On
        admission, the patient suffered from traumatic fever, severe pain in the region of the
        wound, extending over the abdomen, hiccough and vomiting—the vomited matter consisting
        of small particles of greenish matter. There was difficult respiration and anorexia; the
        surface was covered with a cold, clammy perspiration, and there was great difficulty in
        making water. The treatment in this case consisted of a demulcent and anodyne decoction, of
        which a wine-glassful was taken four or five times daily; the free use of cracked ice, and a
        very limited diet of beef-tea, not exceeding six ounces daily. On <date type="injury" when="1865-04-29">April 29th</date>, the patient being seized with severe pain in the
        bowels, passed the ball while defecating. Immediate relief followed, and on May 1st, 1865,
        the patient was doing well. He was discharged the service on <date type="servicedischarge" when="1865-09-22">September 22d, 1865</date>. The missile was contributed to the <name type="hospital" key="431">Army Medical Museum</name>, with the foregoing account, by <name type="person" key="xxx">Acting Assistant Surgeon C. H. Bowen</name>. It is shown in the
        adjoining wood-cut (<hi rend="initialcap">F</hi>IG. 280). Belt is not a pensioner. </p>
