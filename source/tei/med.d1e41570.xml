Acute dysentery.  [This man appears on the hospital register of his regiment, sent to hospital <date type="transfer" when="1864-02-12">February 12</date>—dysentery.]  Pneumonia of an asthenic type supervened almost immediately after his admission.  Treatment: Dover's powder, dry cups to the chest, milk-punch. The dysenteric symptoms subsided, and there were no discharges from the bowels for several days before death.  Died, <date type="death" when="1864-02-23">February 23d</date>.  <hi rend="italic">Autopsy</hi> <date type="autopsy" when="1864-02-24">eighteen hours after death</date>: The lower lobe of the right lung was in the stage of gray hepatization, the other lobes in the stage of red hepatization; the left lung was congested. The intestines presented no evidences of serious disease.</p> 
   <p>⃰ It is to be regretted that, in most instances, the records of this hospital do not show by whom the autopsies were made. It is known that many of them were made by <name type="person" key="134">Surgeon Bentley</name> himself, or under his immediate supervision, but it is only possible to distinguish these from the others in a few cases.</p>
