      Sesler</name>, <name type="organization" key="560">Co. H, 148th New York</name>, aged 28
     years, was wounded in the left thigh, at <name type="BATTLE" key="16">Cold Harbor</name>,
      <date type="injury" when="1864-06-03">June 3, 1864</date>. From the field he passed to <name type="hospital" key="165">Mount Pleasant Hospital</name>, at Washington, and thence, on <date type="transfer" when="1864-06-15">June 15th</date>, to <name type="hospital">Mower, Philadelphia</name>. <name type="person" key="xx">Surgeon J. Hopkinson</name>, <name type="organization" key="132">U. S. V.</name>, in charge of the latter, made the following report:  "The injury was caused by a
     musket ball passing through the inner aspect of the lower third of the limb. There was profuse
     discharge and extensive sloughing, extending down to and ulcerating through the femoral artery,
     and causing hæmorrhage to the amount of from four to six ounces on <date type="operation" when="1864-07-24">July 24th</date>, when the
     vessel was ligated in its continuity, at the middle third of the thigh, one inch above the
     wound. Bleeding recurred to the extent of from six to eight ounces from the lower end of the
     artery on <date type="operation" when="1864-07-28">July 28th</date>, when the distal end of the vessel was ligated in the wound. The operations
     were performed by <name type="person" key="xx">Acting Assistant Surgeon W. P. Moon</name>,
     chloroform being used in the first and ether in the last, and both being followed by prompt
     reaction. The patient did well afterwards.  The subsequent treatment consisted of simple dressings, tonics, and stimulants."  The
     patient was discharged from service on <date type="servicedischarge" when="1865-01-11">January 11,
      1865</date>, and pensioned.  <name type="person" key="xx">Examiner R. C. Dunham</name>, of
     <name type="place">Seneca Falls, New York</name>, certified, <date type="pension" when="1877-08-07">August 7, 1877</date>,
     to the injury, and added that the muscular structures and integuments on the inner side of the
     limb have sloughed out, and that the remaining structures have healed to the bone; also that
     "the leg is swelled below the knee and is sore and tender to the touch; knee partially
     anchylosed. Some important nerves must have been wounded and are healed in the structure with
     the cicatrix, as the leg below the wound is very numb and weak. He cannot walk but a very
     little distance at a time," etc. The pensioner was paid <date type="pension" when="1882-03-04">March 4, 1882</date>.</p>
