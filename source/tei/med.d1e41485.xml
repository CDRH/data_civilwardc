Lynch</name>, <name type="organization" key="xxx">company H, 20th Massachusetts volunteers</name>; age 30; admitted <date type="admit" when="1862-12-02">December 2, 1862</date>.  Chronic diarrhœa of eight weeks duration.  [This man appears on the sick report of his regiment as under treatment for diarrhœa from <date type="admit" when="1862-04-23">April 23d</date> to <date type="hospitaldischarge" when="1862-04-27">April 27, 1862</date>.]  He was extremely emaciated, had large, liquid, and very frequent stools, which, during the last twenty-four hours of his life, were involuntary.  Treatment: Astringents, opiates, stimulants and concentrated food.  Died, <date type="death" when="1862-12-07">December 7th</date>.  <hi rend="italic">Autopsy:</hi> Body extremely emaciated; abdomen sunken. The thoracic viscera were normal. The mesentery was injected; the mesenteric glands enlarged. The mucous membrane of the small intestine was softened, particularly in the lower part of the ileum. The liver was somewhat enlarged and fatty. The spleen large and soft.  [The condition of the large intestine is not recorded.]</p> 
   <p>⃰ It is to be regretted that, in most instances, the records of this hospital do not show by whom the autopsies were made. It is known that many of them were made by <name type="person" key="134">Surgeon Bentley</name> himself, or under his immediate supervision, but it is only possible to distinguish these from the others in a few cases.</p>
