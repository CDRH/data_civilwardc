Infantry</name>, was wounded at the battle of <name type="BATTLE" key="3"><choice><orig>Spottsylvania</orig><reg>Spotsylvania</reg></choice></name>, <date type="injury" when="1864-05-12">May 12, 1864</date>, by a conoidal musket ball, which entered six inches to the left of the umbilicus, and passed directly backward, fracturing the crest of the ilium. He was taken to the Fifth Corps Hospital, and <date type="transfer" when="1864-05-16">four days subsequently</date> was sent in an ambulance to <name type="place">Belle Plain</name>, and thence to <name type="place" key="#Washington">Washington</name>, where he was admitted to <name type="hospital" key="428">Judiciary Square Hospital</name>.  There was no symptom of peritonitis at any time, and the wound gave little trouble, except from the rather copious suppuration attending it.  In the latter part of <date type="duty" when="1864-07">July, 1864</date>, <name type="person" key="xxx">Sergeant Corson</name> was ordered to the headquarters of his regiment, at <name type="place">Fort Preble, Maine</name>.  On <date type="servicedischarge" when="1864-08-29">August 29th</date>, he was discharged from service.  On <date type="duty" when="1864-10-10">October 10, 1864</date>, he was appointed a hospital steward, and was assigned to clerical duty in the <name type="organization" key="xxx">Office of the Surgeon General</name>.  In <date type="pension" when="1865-12">December, 1865</date>, the entrance and exit wounds were still open. From time to time fragments of necrosed bone escaped. It was impossible to pass a probe through the track of the wound without causing pain. There was but slight suppuration. This steward remains on duty in the <name type="organization" key="xxx">Surgeon General's Office</name> at this date, <date type="duty" when="1873-08-02">August 2, 1873</date>.  He now enjoys comparatively good health, and suffers but slight inconvenience from his injury.  The appearance of the cicatrices is shown in the right-hand drawing of <hi rend="initialcap">P</hi>LATE  <hi rend="initialcap">V</hi>, opposite page 81, <hi rend="italic">ante</hi>.</p>
