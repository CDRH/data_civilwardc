                                        Diagnosis—intermittent fever. He had been sick for
                                        five days, during which the bowels were constipated. Three
                                        compound cathartic pills given on admission produced two
                                        copious stools at night. On the 12th the pulse was 90, full
                                        and strong, tongue coated, appetite deficient, skin hot and
                                        moist and urine scanty; there was pain in the head, limbs
                                        and back. Sweet spirit of nitre was prescribed. By the 15th
                                        the skin had become cooler and the headache diminished;
                                        epistaxis occurred twice on this day. Diarrhœa set
                                        in on the 16th, the stools being liquid and yellowish and
                                        the tongue dry and coated. Drowsiness and delirium were
                                        developed on the 18th and recurred particularly at night;
                                        the pulse ran up to 110 and the respiration to 32.
                                        Milk-punch was given and a blister applied to the chest;
                                        squill and seneka were also prescribed. The
                                        diarrhœa meanwhile persisted, and on the 22d three
                                        involuntary stools were passed. Subnitrate of bismuth was
                                        given. The patient rested well on the 27th, and next day was
                                        more rational; the chest symptoms also were much improved.
                                        The diarrhœa continued at the rate of three to five
                                        stools daily, with sometimes severe pain in the bowels,
                                        until October 16, and during this period the tongue was more
                                        or less coated and sometimes dry and the appetite poor.
                                        Wine, brandy, porter, milk-punch, wine-whey and whiskey with
                                        quinine were used. The appetite returned on the 23d, but the
                                        diarrhœa recurred on the 26th and again on November
                                        17, its appearance on the latter date having been attributed
                                        to the use of apple-sauce. About October 1 the foot (side
                                        not stated) became very painful, but no further mention is
                                        made of this until November 13, when the leg was reported as
                                        much swollen, and hop fomentations were prescribed. On the
                                        25th the left leg and foot were swollen and fomentations of
                                        pepper and hops were used. On the 27th chloroform, arnica
                                        and aconite were mixed with olive oil as a liniment for the
                                        left leg and foot, but after this no more information is
                                        given concerning their condition. The patient was furloughed
