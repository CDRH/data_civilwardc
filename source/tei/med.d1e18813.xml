        <hi rend="initialcap">C</hi>ASE.—<name type="person">Private Frederick
          L——</name>, <name type="organization">Co. H, 8th New York Volunteers</name>,
        aged 26 years, having been wounded at <name type="BATTLE" key="263">Cold Harbor,
          Virginia</name>, <date type="injury" when="1864-06-03">June 3d, 1864</date>, was sent to
          <name type="place" key="#Washington">Washington</name>, and admitted to <name type="hospital" key="167">Carver Hospital</name> on <date type="admit" when="1864-06-11">the 11th</date>. A missile had entered the right side of his back, and penetrated the
        vertebral canal, shattering the transverse and articular processes of the eighth and ninth
        dorsal vertebræ. The patient stated that immediately upon the reception of this injury
        he lost all sensation and power of motion below the wound. On admission, he was in a very
        feeble state; there was psychical depression, with slow pulse, labored respiration, cool,
        clammy, and cyanosed skin, and involuntary passages of the excretions. In this forlorn
        condition, he lingered until June 27th, when symptoms of extreme gastric irritability
        supervened, and every form of nourishment was promptly rejected by the stomach. He died on
          <date type="death" when="1864-07-02">July 2d, 1864</date>. At the autopsy, a conoidal
        musket ball was found imbedded in the vertebral canal. The cord appeared to have been
        completely severed at the seat of injury, and was disorganized above and below. A section of
        the injured vertebræ, having the ball in the canal, was forwarded to the <name type="hospital" key="431">Army Medical Museum</name>, with the above account, by <name type="person" key="102">Surgeon O. A. Judson</name>, <name type="organization" key="132">U. S. V.</name> It is represented in the accompanying wood-cut (<hi rend="initialcap">F</hi>IG. 192). </p>
