   <p><hi rend="initialcap">C</hi>ASE 460.—<name type="person" key="1084">Private O.
     Vezina</name>, <name type="organization" key="401">Co. B, 9th New Hampshire</name>, aged 24
    years, was wounded at <name type="BATTLE" key="267">Tolopotomy Creek</name>, <date type="injury" when="1864-05-31">May 31, 1864</date>, and admitted to the field hospital of the 2d division,
    Ninth Corps, where <name type="person" key="xx">Surgeon J. Harris</name>, <name type="organization" key="345">7th Rhode Island</name>, noted: "Shot wound of right leg by
    minié ball." <date type="transfer" when="1864-06-04">Four days after the reception of the
     injury</date> the man was transferred to <name type="hospital" key="162">Douglas
     Hospital</name>, Washington, where the limb was amputated. <name type="person" key="200">Assistant Surgeon W. Thomson</name>, <name type="organization" key="190">U. S. A.</name>, who
    performed the operation, described the case as follows: "The missile entered over the anterior
    surface of the tibia at about the junction of the lower thirds, passed obliquely upward and
    inward, fracturing the bone in several pieces and lodging beneath the integuments, whence it was
    extracted on the field. The fibula was not injured. On admission, the leg was erysipelatous and
    abscesses were burrowing above and below, one of which was opened below the internal malleolus.
    Poultices were applied, and several sloughs of the integuments came away, leaving the muscles
    and tendons exposed. The patient suffered constitutional irritation from continual pain and was
    anxious for amputation, which was performed on <date type="operation" when="1864-06-11">June
     11th</date>, by the antero-posterior flap method, at the lower part of the middle third. The
    stump was dressed with equal parts of tincture of opium and tincture of camphor, and poultices
    were applied until June 18th, when the sloughs had entirely separated. After this, cold-water
    dressings were used and the stump progressed finely. By September 1st, it had been healed for
    some time, with the exception of a fistulous opening leading to necrosed bone. On <date type="operation" when="1864-10-13">October 13th</date>, the patient having for some days
    suffered from great pain and consequent inability to rest, a sequestrum, six inches long and of
    a nearly entire circumference, was, with great difficulty, removed by <name type="person" key="214">Acting Assistant Surgeon H. Gibbons</name>. A large formation of new bone was
    discovered around the cavity thus left in the stump. After the operation the pain ceased, and
    the patient again became cheerful and his appetite good. On December 25th, the opening had
    almost entirely closed." The upper portion of the tibia of the amputated limb, showing eccentric
    splintering by the missile, and necrosis adjacent to the seat of the fracture, was contributed
    by <name type="person" key="200">the operator</name>, and is represented in the wood-cut (<hi rend="initialcap">F</hi>IG. 193). The sequestrum, shown opposite (<hi rend="initialcap">F</hi>IG. 194), was contributed by <name type="person" key="201">Assistant Surgeon W. F.
     Norris</name>, <name type="organization" key="190">U. S. A.</name> The patient was discharged
    from service <date type="servicedischarge" when="1865-06-14">June 14, 1865</date>, and furnished
    with an artificial limb one month afterwards by <name type="person" key="xx">B. F.
    Palmer</name>, of <name type="place" key="xx">Philadelphia</name>. The pensioner was paid <date type="pension" when="1878-06-04">June 4, 1878</date>.</p>
