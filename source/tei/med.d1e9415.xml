                                        examination: Body slightly emaciated. The lungs, heart and
                                        pericardium were normal. The liver was congested; the
                                        gall-bladder somewhat distended; the spleen enlarged and
                                        congested, weight eleven ounces. The mesenteric and
                                        meso-colic glands were much enlarged and there was
                                        considerable venous congestion of the intestinal peritoneum.
                                        The mucous membrane of the lower jejunum and ileum was
                                        congested in patches, the congestion increasing
                                        progressively downwards, the last two feet being much
                                        congested, with, in the last six inches, several deep
                                        circular ulcers having yellow bases and raised edges;
                                        Peyer's patches were not elsewhere ulcerated. The colon was
                                        of a deep mahogany color, especially in the ascending
                                        portion. The pyramids of the kidneys were congested, the
                                        cortical substance pale.—<hi rend="italic"><name type="hospital" key="173">Harewood
