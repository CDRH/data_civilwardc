                    pensioned, and reported by <name type="person" key="1244">Pension Examining
                        Surgeon H. M. Montgomery</name>, of <name type="place">Rochester, New York</name>, <date type="pension" when="1863-01">January, 1863</date>, as having had a series

                        Montgomery</name> states that the wound was
                    then discharging pus, but that the patient would probably be free from
                    disability in a few months, and that he appeared "fat and hearty."  In <date type="pension" when="1865-11">November, 1865</date>, <name type="person" key="1246">Pension Examining Surgeon J. K. Hyde</name> reported that this
                    pensioner complained of increase of pain and dizziness on attempting to labor,
                    and that he had applied for an increase of his pension, in a letter from
                    <name type="place">Lancaster, Wisconsin</name>; but no disability except dizziness is certified to. In the
                    army such applicants are regarded as malingerers; but in the civil service a
                    greater latitude prevails.</p>
