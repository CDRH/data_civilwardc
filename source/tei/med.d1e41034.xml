Typhoid fever, contracted a month previously at <name type="BATTLE" key="4">Fredericksburg</name>.  The patient was very much reduced, emaciated, had an exhausting diarrhœa, from ten to twelve thin watery evacuations daily, and much abdominal tenderness. Was ordered tonics, stimulants, and nourishing diet.  January 15th: Some slight improvement is noticed; there are but six evacuations in the twenty-four hours.  January 20th: diarrhœa still better. The abdominal tenderness is subsiding, but erysipelas has set in. The eruption extended over the face and a portion of the scalp, but disappeared in the course of a few days, after which the diarrhœa grew worse again, there being about ten evacuations daily. The patient became exceedingly weak, could be aroused with difficulty, and his death was almost hourly expected till February 2d, when he began again slowly to improve.  By the 15th the evacuations were reduced to one or two daily; they were of greater consistence, and he began to gain appetite and strength.  February 24th: Is not so well; ate no breakfast; the diarrhœa is again troublesome; tongue furred.  February 25th: Pneumonia was recognized: there was much cough, pain in the chest, and rusty sputa.
