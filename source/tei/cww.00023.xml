                <p>
               <persName>Walter S. Cox</persName>, being duly sworn, deposes &amp; says: I
                    am well acquainted with the boy <persName>Andrew</persName> named in the
                    aforegoing petition of <persName>John Dickson</persName>; his mother has been a
                    servant in my house for a number of years and he was partially brought up there.
                    They were both the property of my grandfather, the late <persName>Col. John
                        Cox</persName>, and <persName>Andrew</persName> was given by him to his
                    daughter, the wife of <persName>Watkins Addison</persName> and was always
                    regarded and treated as her property by the rest of the family.
                        <persName>Andrew</persName> is a strong healthy boy, very smart, understands
                    cooking, waiting and all that pertains to household management, and I think,
                    would command as high a price as any house servant, of his age, that I know. I
                    do not think $1,500 too high a valuation of him.</p>
                <p>I was trustee in the deed given by <persName>W. Addison</persName>, referred to
                    the petition and was cognizant of the facts relating to it, and from my
                    recollection of them, they are correctly set forth in the petition</p>

                <p>The Petition of <persName>John Dickson</persName> respectfully <choice><orig>shews</orig><reg>shows</reg></choice>, that he had
                    a claim to the service or labor of a certain person of African descent, named
                        <persName>Andrew Montgomery</persName>, who was discharged from said claim
                    by the Act of Congress aforesaid, that said <persName>Andrew
                        Montgomery</persName> was the slave for life of <persName>Watkins
                        Addison</persName>, of <placeName>Georgetown, D.C.</placeName> and was, by him, conveyed to <persName>Walter S. Cox</persName>,
                    by Bill of Sale dated <date when="1860-08-06">August 6, 1860</date>, recorded in
                    Liber J.A.S. No. 203, fol. 70 &amp;, of the Land Records of the
                        <placeName>County of Washington, D.C.</placeName> in trust to secure a note

                        Cox</persName> was accommodating endorser, for the sum of six hundred and
                    forty dollars; that there remains of said debt, a balance of three hundred and
                    seventy five 66/100, dollars bearing interest from the <date when="1862-04-17">17th day of April</date>, ultimo, which is, therefore the extent of your
                    Petitioner's claim upon said negro.</p>
                <p>He further shews that said <persName>Andrew</persName>
                
            
            <pb xml:id="leaf002v" facs="cww.00023.004.jpg"/>

                    Congress aforesaid, that your Petitioner's claim existed at the date of the
                    passage of the act and does not originate in or by virtue of any transfer
                    heretofore made by any person who has in any manner aided or sustained the
                    present rebellion against the government of the United States.</p> 
                <p>Your Petitioner hereby declares that he bears true and faithful allegiance to the
