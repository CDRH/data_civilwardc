          Carolina Regiment</name>, aged 30 years, received, at the battle of <name type="BATTLE" key="259">the Wilderness</name>, <date type="injury" when="1864-05-07">May 7, 1864</date>,
        a gunshot wound of the face. The missile entered the left temple, passing obliquely
        anteriorly, and emerging one inch below the left eye, severely fracturing and comminuting
        the superior maxilla, and completely destroying the nasal bones. He was among the captured
        wounded sent on hospital transports to Washington, and on <date type="admit" when="1864-05-14">May 14th</date> was admitted to <name type="hospital" key="167">Carver
          Hospital</name>. He was very low, and in a comatose state, requiring considerable exertion
        to arouse him sufficiently to partake of food and stimulants, which were freely
        administered. He took a quart of milk punch daily. Detergent lotions were applied to the
        wound. The contents of the left orbit were evacuated, and the vision was destroyed in the
        right eye. Inflammation gradually extended to the brain; but without any very violent
        symptoms. The patient survived twenty days, death resulting <date type="death" when="1864-05-27">May 27th, 1864</date>. <name type="person">Acting Assistant Surgeon J.
          E. Winants</name> reported the case and sent the specimen, figured in the wood-cut (<hi rend="initialcap">F</hi>IG. 156), to the <name type="hospital" key="431">Army Medical
          Museum</name>. The right malar, the bodies of both superior maxillaries, both lachrymal
        bones, the body of the ethmoid, with the turbinated bones, the left great ala of the
        sphenoid, and the left external angular process of the frontal with the orbital plate have
        been carried away. The left parietal is fissured from the anterior inferior angle to the
        parietal eminence. The left palate bone is fractured across, the sphenoid cells are exposed,
        and the cranial cavity is freely opened. The edges of the fractured bones are slightly
        necrosed and show traces of an attempt at repair.</p>
