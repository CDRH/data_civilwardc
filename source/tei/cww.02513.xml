                <p>So rapid is the whirl of events that we find <lb/>it impossible to write as we desire of things as <lb/>we find them here. The amount of common, <lb/>and therefore good, sense found among the <lb/>leading men is truly wonderful. The needs of <lb/>the country are as transparent to them as to <lb/>any member of President Lincoln's Cabinet; <lb/>and they understand quite as well how the <lb/>woes of that country are to be assuaged.</p>
                
                <p>But what is most interesting is the personal <lb/>experience of these menâ€”aye, of the women <lb/>too! They can tell you of circumstances <lb/>which, although years have passed away since <lb/>some of them occurred, have the power to <choice><orig>cur-<lb/>dle</orig><reg>curdle</reg></choice> the blood in your veins. What an <choice><orig>inex-<lb/>haustible</orig><reg>inexhaustible</reg></choice> storehouse this subject of slavery <lb/>will be to the poets and tale and song-writers <lb/>of the next hundred years, and how many of <lb/>the men whose hand we have had the great <lb/>privilege to grasp will find a place in those <lb/>poems, tales and songs?</p>

                <p>The manner in which we have been treated <lb/>by the trustees of many of the churches here <lb/>has not only filled us with gratitude, but <lb/>placed us under peculiar obligations to them. <lb/>The pastors of all these churches have not <lb/>only given their willing consent to the use of <lb/>their edifices by us, but the most of them have <lb/>given their invaluable assistance in filling the <lb/>houses and conducting the meetings.</p>
                
                <p>The following are the names of the churches <lb/>and their pastors where we have held <choice><orig>meet-<lb/>ings</orig><reg>meetings</reg></choice>, the trustees and pastors of which will <lb/>please accept our most grateful thanks: Israel <lb/>A. M. E. Church, Rev. H. M. Turner, Pastor; <lb/>Zion Wesley Church, Rev. J. D. Brooks, Pastor; <lb/>Asbury M. E. Church; Union Bethel Church, <lb/>Rev. J. P. Handy, Pastor; John Wesley A. M. <lb/>E. Church, Rev. J. P. Hamer, Pastor; <choice><orig>Gal-<lb/>breath</orig><reg>Galbreath</reg></choice> Chapel, Rev. R. H. Dyson; Third <choice><orig>Bap-<lb/>tist</orig><reg>Baptist</reg></choice> Church, Rev. A. Bouldin, Pastor; Mission <lb/>Chapel, E street, Island, Rev. J. J. Herbert; <lb/>Bethel Church, Good Hope, Rev. D. Smith, <choice><orig>Pas-<lb/>tor</orig><reg>Pastor</reg></choice>.  All of these places were furnished us free <lb/>of chargeâ€”the Israel and Asbury charges <lb/>being furnished us twice on the same terms.</p>
                
                <p>Our thanks are also due to the many friends <lb/>who have made our stay in this city so very <lb/>agreeable socially.  To designate by name <lb/>where so much hospitality has been shown <lb/>would not only be invidious, but be in very <lb/>bad taste.</p>

                <head type="main" subtype="authorial" rend="center">A LADY NARRATORâ€”A THRILLING STORY.</head>
                
                <p>Mrs. R<gap reason="illegible" quantity="5" unit="chars"/> Williams of this city, who was <lb/>carried away to the South about seven years <lb/>ago, gave an account of her sufferings in and <lb/>escape from that guilty portion of our country, <lb/>on the evening of the 12th instant, in John <lb/>Wesley Church.</p>
                
                <p>The house was well filled, and our Northern <lb/>readers may know that if a Washington <choice><orig>audi-<lb/>ence</orig><reg>audience</reg></choice>, who are so used to these tales of <choice><orig>suffer-<lb/>ing</orig><reg>suffering</reg></choice>, could listen with the most intense <choice><orig>excite-<lb/>ment</orig><reg>excitement</reg></choice> to this lady's story, it must have been <lb/>most thrilling.  What was most wonderful <lb/>about it, perhaps, was the manner in which it <lb/>was delivered.  Such calmness, such complete <lb/>mastery over her feelings, when reciting the <lb/>perils through which she and her babe and <choice><orig>fel-<lb/>low-servants</orig><reg>fellow-servants</reg></choice> passed, we never saw equalled. <lb/>Not in one instance did the emotion which <lb/>kept welling up from the fountain of an <choice><orig>over-<lb/>flowing</orig><reg>overflowing</reg></choice> heart get the better of her, and yet <lb/>how easy it was to perceive that a flood of <lb/>tears was continually trying to get the <choice><orig>mas-<lb/>tery</orig><reg>mastery</reg></choice> of that stoicism.  The story of this <choice><orig>wo-<lb/>man's</orig><reg>woman's</reg></choice> wrongs will soon be put to press, <choice><orig>there-<lb/>fore</orig><reg>therefore</reg></choice> we shall refrain from giving any of her <lb/>remarks at this time.</p>
                
                <p>As the work will be of deep interest, we will <lb/>endeavor to let our readers know when it shall <lb/>come from the press.</p>
                
                <p>At the conclusion of her remarks, we were <lb/>invited to make a few remarks and sing a <lb/>song, but what could we say in the presence <lb/>of a woman who had been a Moses to a large <lb/>number of our brethren, leading them safely <lb/>out of the house of bondage into the Union <lb/>lines?  Our stammering tongue soon lagged, <lb/>and we were glad to take refuge behind one of <lb/>our songs.</p>
                
                <p>A handsome collection was lifted, and <choice><orig>pre-<lb/>sented</orig><reg>presented</reg></choice> to the lady by the Rev. Mr. Hamer.</p>

                <head type="main" subtype="authorial" rend="center">DEATH OF JUDGE DEAN.</head>
                
                <p>Our readers may remember that we <choice><orig>pub-<lb/>lished</orig><reg>published</reg></choice>, a short time since, an account of a slave <lb/>trial in this city in which the above-named <lb/>gentleman acted as counsel for the slave.</p>
                
                <p>Of course, in coming to Washington, we <lb/>were quite anxious to shake the hand of such <lb/>a faithful friend, and we got an opportunity, <lb/>for we had the good fortune to meet him on <lb/>Pennsylvania avenue.  After an introduction <lb/>by our friend, Mr. Thos. H. C. Hinton, the <lb/>Judge kindly entered into a long conversation, <lb/>giving us much of his personal history during <lb/>his residence here.</p>
                
                <p>Judge Dean has done much for the poor <lb/>escaping bondman since he has been here, but <lb/>always without recompense or reward.  The <lb/>nobility of his soul shone out in many ways <lb/>which we could enumerate, testified to by <choice><orig>cred-<lb/>ible</orig><reg>credible</reg></choice> witnesses, but we have reason to believe <lb/>that this will be attended to by abler hands. <lb/>Even when the Judge got in trouble from the <lb/>above-named case, he endeavored to elevate <lb/>the black man.  His bail was $1,000, and <choice><orig>al-<lb/>though</orig><reg>although</reg></choice> he might have secured many white <lb/>men who would have willingly stood for him, <lb/>yet he would not rest until he had given a <lb/>colored man a chance to stand in that <choice><orig>respon-<lb/>sible</orig><reg>responsible</reg></choice> position.  Messrs. G. Snowden and W. <lb/>Lewis gladly stepped forward, and the latter <lb/>gentleman had the honor of standing his bail.</p>
                
                <p>On Wednesday evening, 13th <choice><abbr>inst.</abbr><expan>instant</expan></choice>, a <choice><orig>num-<lb/>ber</orig><reg>number</reg></choice> of colored gentlemen proposed to present <lb/>to the Judge, at a meeting which we held in <lb/>Asbury M. E. Church, a splendid cane which <lb/>cost them $40 ; but on the 15th <choice><abbr>inst.</abbr><expan>instant</expan></choice>, after one <lb/>week's illness, this noble man breathed his <lb/>last, and the cane was presented the next day <lb/>to his wife.</p>
                
                <p>The funeral took place on Saturday, the 17th, <lb/>from the Unitarian Church, the Rev. John <choice><orig>Pier-<lb/>pont</orig><reg>Pierpont</reg></choice> making a few instructive remarks <choice><orig>pre-<lb/>vious</orig><reg>previous</reg></choice> to the body being conveyed to the tomb. <lb/>Judge Dean has a son in Gen. Meade's army, <lb/>who was able to reach home just in time to <lb/>attend the funeral; so it is a great pleasure <lb/>to know that the splendid token of regard <lb/>aforementioned will fall into the hands of a <lb/>good Union soldier.</p>

                <p>We regret to announce that the above-named <lb/>gentleman, the father of Augustus <choice><orig>Washing-<lb/>ton</orig><reg>Washington</reg></choice>, Esq., of Monrovia, Liberia, and Mrs. C. <lb/>W.

                <p>Mrs. Groves arrived in this city on Friday <lb/>evening, and, on visiting the hospital the next <lb/>day, found that her father had been buried the <lb/>day before.

                <p>Among the notables brought to this city by <lb/>the late Odd Fellows' celebration was Mr. <lb/>David B. Bowser, the artist of Philadelphia. <lb/>Mr. B. brought with him a photographed copy <lb/>of his celebrated flag, designed and painted for <lb/>the 6th Regiment U. S. Colored Troops.  The <lb/>copy, which was handsomely framed, he <choice><orig>pre-<lb/>sented</orig><reg>presented</reg></choice> to the President on Tuesday the 13th <lb/>instant.</p>
                
                <p>There was no one present at this <choice><orig>presenta-<lb/>tion</orig><reg>presentation</reg></choice> but the President and the artist, but we <lb/>learn from Mr. Bowser that Mr. Lincoln <choice><orig>ex-<lb/>pressed</orig><reg>expressed</reg></choice> much pleasure and gratification on the <lb/>occasion; but we do not believe that he felt a <lb/>tenth part of the joy that friend Bowser did in <lb/>being permitted to present his artistic <choice><orig>produc-<lb/>tion</orig><reg>production</reg></choice> to one who was so worthy of his highest <lb/>regard.  Any person desirous of obtaining a <lb/>copy of the flag can get it by writing to Mr. <lb/>Bowser at Philadelphia.</p>
