Autopsy August 2d, one hour after admission into <name type="hospital" key="162">Douglas Hospital</name>. The
     ball entered over inner third of right clavicle, fracturing it, wounding the apex of the right lung, and passed out obliquely, striking the seventh cervical vertebra, and was cut out
     underneath the skin near the inferior angle of the scapula. The lung was too much decomposed to make a preparation of. The ball had evidently exploded after it struck him. There was a great
     amount of hæmorrhage, but the body was too much disorganized to allow of finding its seat. The specimens are the clavicle and ball."  The specimens were received at the <name type="hospital" key="431">Army Medical Museum</name>, and the clavicle is numbered 1644 of the <hi rend="italic">Surgical Section</hi>, but the missile is not attached and a careful search failed to discover any trace of it.</p>
