          P——</name>, <name type="organization" key="xxx">Co. B, 5th Wisconsin
          Volunteers</name>, aged 24 years, was wounded at <name type="BATTLE" key="10">Chancellorsville</name>, <date type="injury" when="1863-05-03">May 3d, 1863</date>, by a
        conoidal ball, which entered between the sixth and seventh ribs, an inch outward of the
        mammillary line, grazing and fracturing the seventh rib. He was treated in the field
        hospital, and, on <date type="transfer" when="1863-05-08">May 8th</date>, was transferred to
          <name type="hospital" key="162">Douglas Hospital</name>, Washington. When admitted, the
        patient was suffering from very severe dyspnœa, accompanied by an incessant, painful,
        and annoying cough; respiration was very frequent, forced, and superficial, he stated that
        he had spat blood after the injury, but not the least tinge of blood was observable in the
        thick frothy mucous expectoration. An abundant effusion in the left thoracic cavity easily
        accounted for the dyspnœa. Purgatives, diaphoretics, and stimulants were administered
        and counter-irritants applied over the left side of the chest, with water dressings to the
        wound. He died <date type="death" when="1863-05-10">May 10th, 1863</date>. At the <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> examination, sixteen hours after death, old adhesions were
        found in the right lung and fresh ones in the left. The effusion of sero-sanguinolent fluid
        in the left cavity was the immediate cause of death. Paracentesis thoracis would have proved
        of but little avail, as the diaphragm was perforated and the spleen and left kidney badly
        bruised and injured. The ball lodged parallel to the transverse process of the fourth lumbar
        vertebra, near the spine. The case was exceedingly interesting, because the patient had
        manifested no abdominal symptoms, had no blood in his urine, and voided it freely and
        without pain in spite of the extensive injury to the left kidney. The case is reported by
          <name type="person" key="208">Acting Assistant Surgeon Carlos Carvallo</name>. The
        missile, with the merest contusion of the rings at one point, was forwarded to the <name type="hospital" key="431">Army Medical Museum</name> by <name type="person" key="200">Assistant Surgeon W. Thomson</name>, <name type="organization" key="190">U. S. A.</name>,
        and is represented in the adjoining wood-cut (<hi rend="initialcap">F</hi>IG. 290). </p>
