    report: "The patient entered <name type="hospital" key="512">Third Division Hospital</name>, <name type="place">Alexandria</name>, <date type="transfer" when="1864-05-26">three weeks after receiving a wound</date> of the right knee joint,
    the ball passing beneath the patella. The bones were not much fractured, but the joint was swollen and painful and the leg
    œdematous. Circular amputation at the knee joint, by skin flaps, was performed on <date type="operation" when="1864-06-02">June 2d</date>, sulphuric ether being employed as
    the anæsthetic. At the time of the operation the patient had become very weak, his pulse quick and feeble, and he perspired
    considerably, had cough and spat up blood. He reacted very well. Tonics, stimulants, and nourishing diet were given, and
    simple dressings used. The wound healed up kindly, and the patient's general condition became much improved." The patient
    was subsequently treated at various hospitals, and finally, after being provided with an artificial leg, he was discharged <date type="servicedischarge" when="1865-09-09">September 9, 1865</date>, and pensioned. <name type="person" key="xxx">Examining Surgeon E.

    preservation of the patella." The pensioner was paid <date type="pension" when="1880-03-04">March 4, 1880</date>. In his application for commutation he represented the
    stump of the amputated limb as being in a "sound" condition.</p>
