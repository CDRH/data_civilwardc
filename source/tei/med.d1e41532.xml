Jerome Northrup</name>, <name type="organization" key="xxx">company G, 141st New York volunteers</name>; admitted <date type="admit" when="1863-09-26">September 26, 1863</date>.  Chronic diarrhœa.  The patient was much emaciated. The discharges from the bowels averaged ten daily; they were accompanied by great pain and tenesmus. He had a slight cough and a dull heavy pain in the lower part of the right lung, with the physical signs of pneumonia in the first stage.  September 28th: Is somewhat better; there are now but four passages daily.  October 2d: Copious diaphoresis, with cramps in the lower extremities.  Died, <date type="death" when="1863-10-04">October 4th</date>.  <hi rend="italic">Autopsy</hi> <date type="autopsy" when="1863-10-04">ten hours after death</date>: The lower lobe of the right lung was congested. The mucous membrane of the ileum was much inflamed; its solitary and agminated glands were enlarged. There was considerable thickening and contraction of the gut in the vicinity of the ileo-cæcal valve. The liver was much enlarged.   [There is no record of the condition of the large intestine.]</p> 
   <p>⃰ It is to be regretted that, in most instances, the records of this hospital do not show by whom the autopsies were made. It is known that many of them were made by <name type="person" key="134">Surgeon Bentley</name> himself, or under his immediate supervision, but it is only possible to distinguish these from the others in a few cases.</p>
