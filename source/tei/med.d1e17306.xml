                                                      1861</date>, received a blow on the head from the butt of
                                                  a musket. He was admitted to the <name type="hospital">Washington

                                                  made an incision across it. bringing the fractured
                                                  left parietal into view. There was apparently but
                                                  slight depression of the outer table. The inner
                                                  table proved to be fractured in a stellate form

                                                  removed. The patient had comatose symptoms. As
                                                  soon as the operation was performed he regained
                                                  consciousness, but again lapsed into a state of
                                                  stupor. On the following morning, he answered
                                                  questions coherently. Recovery took place without
                                                  further untoward symptoms. Reported by the
