                                        Diagnosis—typhoid fever. He had been healthy till
                                        <date type="injury" when="1861-10-20">Oct. 20</date>, when he was taken with chills, fever,
                                        perspirations, pain in the head, back and limbs, lassitude,
                                        anorexia, thirst, vomiting, diarrhœa and cough with
                                        expectoration. On the fifth he was wakeful, eyes suffused,
                                        cheeks flushed, pulse 120, quick and bounding, skin hot,
                                        perspiring and covered with eruption and sudamina on the
                                        chest and abdomen, tongue moist and white-coated, bowels
                                        slightly relaxed, tympanitic and tender in the iliac and
                                        epigastric regions; he had some appetite, much thirst,
                                        slight cough and somewhat accelerated respiration. Quinine
                                        and tincture of iron were prescribed, with sinapisms to the
                                        abdomen. On the 7th the tenderness and tympanites were
                                        lessened. The mustard was repeated and Dover's powder given
                                        at night. He had some headache on the 8th and became
                                        delirious on the 10th. Here the record closes abruptly with
                                        the announcement of death on <date type="death" when="1861-11-23">the 23d</date>. Turpentine emulsion
                                        was administered on the 8th. </p>
