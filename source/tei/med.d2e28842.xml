     was wounded at <name type="BATTLE" key="10">Chancellorsville</name>, <date type="injury" when="1863-05-03">May 3, 1863</date>.  On <date type="admit" when="1863-05-07">May 7th</date>
     he was admitted into <name type="hospital" key="162">Douglas Hospital</name>, Washington. A minié ball had entered the internal portion of the calf of the right leg, lacerated the posterior tibial vessels, comminuted both bones, and lodged in the gastrocnemius muscle.  When admitted to the hospital his general condition was tolerable, and the injury to the vessels was not detected, as the heat and appearance of the foot were good. On <date type="operation" when="1863-05-09">May 9th</date> it was noticed that dry gangrene was beginning in the foot, and, after free stimulation during that day, a circular amputation was done in the lower third of the thigh by <name type="person" key="200">Assistant Surgeon W. Thomson</name>, <name type="organization" key="190">U. S. A.</name>  The patient reacted well and had no bad symptoms from the moment of the amputation. The ligature around the femoral artery separated on the tenth day, and by May 22d nearly one-half of the
     flap had united. A slight tendency to diarrhœa was readily checked by laudanum enemata. The patient was discharged <date type="hospitaldischarge" when="1863-08-26">August 26, 1863</date>; stump quite well; patient strong and hearty.</p>
