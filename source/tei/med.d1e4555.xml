                                        the 8th the mind was somewhat dull; the patient continued to
                                        be up and to walk about occasionally. Sugar of lead and
                                        opium were given. No material change took place until the
                                        11th, when the warm and moist skin showed sudamina and some
                                        rose-colored spots on the abdomen, the tongue at this time
                                        being pale, flabby and coated gray, the bowels but slightly

                                        patient was drowsy on the 12th, and on the following day the
                                        tongue became brown and cracked but remained pale at the
                                        tip, the skin hot and dry, the breathing hurried, and the
                                        bowels moved eight times but free from pain and distention.
                                        On the 14th the tongue was dry and the countenance haggard.
                                        Two grains of quinine and one of calomel were prescribed for
                                        administration three times daily. Profuse perspirations
                                        occurred on the 15th, but the diarrhœa continued
                                        and sordes appeared on the teeth. Turpentine emulsion was
                                        given. On the evening of the 16th there was some tenderness
                                        of the abdomen and the patient kept tossing his head from
                                        side to side. On the 18th the pulse was 80, weak and small,
                                        tongue heavily coated, brown in the middle and red at tip
                                        and edges, skin hot and moist, bowels not tender but quite
                                        loose, especially at night. On the 19th there was some
                                        tenderness in the right iliac region. Ten stools were passed
                                        on the 22d, and on the following day the abdomen was
                                        tympanitic. The record closes abruptly with the announcement
                                        of death on <date type="death" when="1861-09-28">the 28th</date>. </p>
