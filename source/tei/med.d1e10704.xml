                                age 22; was admitted from <name type="hospital">Augur hospital</name>, <name type="place">Alexandria, Va.</name>,

                                        tonsillitis, with exudation and sthenic pyrexia.  The disease
                                        at first appeared to yield partially to treatment, but
                                        later it <choice><sic>devoloped</sic><corr>developed</corr></choice> a distinct diphtheritic character; the
                                        local affection increased in severity, the false membrane
                                        appearing on the walls of the pharynx and gradually
                                        extending.  About a week after admission the patient's
                                        stomach became irritable, and for the last two days before
                                        death nothing was retained except a little water from ice
                                        melting in the mouth. The fever continued sthenic in
                                        character until <date type="injury" when="1865-02-22">two days before</date> death, when the system began
                                to suffer from imperfect æration of the blood. From that
                                        time the purple hue of the skin became increasingly marked.
                                        Latterly very little urine was voided, but no uræmic
                                        effects were observable, the mind being perfectly clear
                                        until death, which occurred on <date type="death" when="1865-02-24">the 24th</date>.  The case was
                                        treated at first with saline laxatives and Dover's powder,
                                        with tincture of iron internally in doses of fifteen drops
                                        repeated every four hours,—applied locally by
                                        sponge and used diluted as a gargle. Nitrate of silver and
                                        alum solutions were also employed as topical
                                        applications. Afterwards lime-water was given with
                                        milk; sinapisms and a blister were applied to the
                                        epigastrium and nutrient enemata administered.   <hi rend="italic">Post-mortem</hi> examination: The tonsils and larynx were much inflamed; the
                                        trachea lined throughout with a firm false membrane, which,
                                        on the left side, extended into the ramifications of the
                                        bronchus; the bronchial tubes of the right lung were greatly
                                        inflamed but not lined with membrane; the lungs were
                                        healthy. The heart contained a firm washed clot in each
                                        ventricle, the right clot being larger and more firmly
                                        attached than the other. The stomach, liver, spleen and
                                        intestines were normal.  [<hi rend="italic">Specimen</hi> 515, Med. Sec, <name type="hospital" key="431">Army Medical Museum</name>, from this case, shows the
