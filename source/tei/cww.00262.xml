                <!-- I've chosen to encode this deed (so named on the "cover," but formerly transcribed as a bill of sale, which may better describe this section of the petition; please review) by breaking it out into sections, or <div2>s. The first section, represented in the image cww.00262.005, functions a bit like the petition cover. Subsequent sections (represented in image files cww.00262.006 & .007) include a statement that appears to be signed by Francis Hume, relinquishing named slaves to Charles Hume, and a statement witnessing this deed of gift. The structure of this section, i.e., use of <div2>s, may need to be double-checked. Also, the order of the leaves in this object may need to be double-checked as well. Specifically, the following three leaves appear to be a deed in support of Charles Hume's petition for compensation; however, it currently follows Anna Hume's petition. Grouping each petition and its supporting documents in order may not be something we're concerned with, but I did want to mention this issue here. JC, 9/21/11.-->
