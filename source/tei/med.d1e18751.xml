                                                  third of the scapula at its inner edge, passed

                                                  the thorax. He was admitted, on <date type="admit" when="1863-05-03">the next day</date>, to
                                                                the <name type="hospital" key="192">Mansion House Hospital</name>, <name type="place">Alexandria</name>. On
                                                  admission, he was found to have paraplegia and
                                                  complete loss of sensation of all parts of the
                                                  body below the fourth dorsal vertebra.
                                                  Stimulants and tonics, with nourishing and
                                                  sustaining diet, were given. On May 12th,
                                                  pneumonia of the left lung set in, which rapidly
                                                  passed into the third stage. His tongue was clean
                                                  and appetite tolerably good, but his pulse was
                                                  frequent and feeble. An expectorant was given,
                                                  with an anodyne at bedtime. By <date type="injury" when="1863-05-20">May 20th</date>, a cavity
                                                  had formed in the lower portion of the left lung
                                                  containing fluid. His appetite and strength were
                                                  diminishing. On the 22d, several gangrenous spots
                                                  appeared on the lower extremities. His urine and
                                                  fæces passed continuously and involuntarily, the
                                                  urine displaying the turbid appearance and strong
                                                  ammoniacal odor so characteristic of lesions of
                                                  the spinal cord. He continued to grow worse and
                                                  died on <date type="death" when="1863-05-27">May 27th, 1863</date>. At the autopsy, the lower
                                                  and part of the upper lobe of the left lung were
                                                  found entirely destroyed and converted into
                                                  sanious fluid, of which there were found three
                                                  pints in the cavity of the pleura. The ball was
                                                  found to have passed obliquely downward and
                                                  forward, and lodged in the body of the fourth rib,
                                                  fracturing, in its course, the spine of the fourth
                                                  dorsal vertebra. The spinal cord at this point was
                                                  found softened and disintegrated. The pathological
                                                  specimen is No. 1600, Section I, A. M. M., and was
