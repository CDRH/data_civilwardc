The ball entered the left thoracic cavity, penetrated the diaphragm, wounded the left kidney, and emerged immediately over the spinal column. Internal hæmorrhage occurred, and continued for several days. Acetate of lead and pulverized opium were given, with topical applications of ice-cold water, to control the hæmorrhage.  On September 8th, the wound became gangrenous; nitric acid was applied, and <choice><sic>morphiæ</sic><corr>morphia</corr></choice> was administered, and stimulants and tonics were given freely. The gangrene extended, finally involving the spinal cord and its investments, and causing death on <date type="death" when="1864-09-10">September 10, 1864</date>." </p>
