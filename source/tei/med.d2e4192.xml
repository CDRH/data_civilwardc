He was admitted to a Cavalry field hospital, where <name type="person" key="xxx">Surgeon <hi rend="initialcap">J</hi>. <hi rend="initialcap">B</hi>. <hi rend="initialcap">W</hi>. <hi rend="initialcap">M</hi>ITCHELL</name>, <name type="organization" key="xxx">8th Pennsylvania Cavalry</name>, noted: "Wound of left thigh by a pistol ball." <name type="person" key="xxx">Surgeon <hi rend="initialcap">J</hi>. <hi rend="initialcap">A</hi>. <hi rend="initialcap">L</hi>IDELL</name>, <name type="organization" key="132"><hi rend="initialcap">U</hi>. <hi rend="initialcap">S</hi>. <hi rend="initialcap">V</hi>.</name>, recorded his admission to <name type="hospital" key="175">Stanton Hospital</name>, Washington, <date type="transfer" when="1863-06-23">June 23d</date>, with "wound of thigh," and his "return to duty on <date type="hospitaldischarge" when="1863-11-25">November 25, 1863</date>." It is believed, however, that the man did not return to active field service, but was discharged from the hospital only to accompany his command when changing station from the <name type="organization" key="377">Army of the Potomac</name> to the Western armies. He was subsequently admitted to <name type="place">Camp Gamble</name>, whence he was transferred to the Lawson Hospital, <name type="place">St. Louis</name>, on <date type="transfer" when="1864-02-15">February 15, 1864</date>. <name type="person" key="xxx">Surgeon <hi rend="initialcap">C</hi>. <hi rend="initialcap">T</hi>. <hi rend="initialcap">A</hi>LEXANDER</name>, <name type="organization" key="190"><hi rend="initialcap">U</hi>. <hi rend="initialcap">S</hi>. <hi rend="initialcap">A</hi>.</name>, reported: "Gunshot wound of left thigh two inches below Poupart s ligament; ball passing downward, inward, and lodging. Wound healed when admitted. General condition good; uses crutches. Patient discharged from service <date type="servicedischarge" when="1864-02-27">February 27, 1864</date>." <name type="person" key="xxx">Examiner <hi rend="initialcap">C</hi>. <hi rend="initialcap">H</hi>AY</name>, of <name type="place">Warsaw, Illinois</name>, certified, <date type="pension" when="1865-12-20">December 20, 1865</date>: "A pistol ball entered the anterior upper third of the thigh, ranging towards the hip joint. The joint was in all probability injured, as he has not been able to move the limb upward since the casualty. The ball was lodged in or near the hip joint, upon the thigh bone, and still rests there. The bones composing the hip joint are now carious. The urinary organs are much deranged in their functions."  </p>
