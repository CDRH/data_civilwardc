                                        by fever, weakness, anorexia, pain in the back and bones,
                                        nausea, vomiting and diarrhœa, which continued up
                                        to the date of his admission. He said he felt better about
                                        noontime daily. On November 2 he was dull, his eyes slightly
                                        suffused, pulse 112, quick and of fair strength, skin soft
                                        and moist, tongue soft, coated in the centre and at the tip,
                                        teeth covered with sordes; he had anorexia, much thirst and
                                        a diarrhœa of four stools daily, with some
                                        abdominal tenderness and some cough. Quinine in five-grain
                                        doses was given three times daily. Next day his condition
                                        was unchanged but on the 4th the pulse became reduced to 100
                                        and lost its quickness and strength, the skin was hot and
                                        covered with minute rose-colored spots, the tongue moist and
                                        brown, eyes injected and the respiration labored. The
                                        patient continued dull and drowsy on the 6th, and the
                                        diarrhœa persisted, with some tenderness in both
                                        iliac regions; but the tongue appeared cleaner at the edges
                                        and the respiration was natural. On the 7th the pulse was
                                        108 and weak, the skin dry, husky and covered with
                                        rose-colored spots, the tongue dry and brown, the gums and
                                        teeth blackened, the bowels loose, tympanitic, tender and
                                        gurgling on pressure. The record leaves the patient in this
                                        condition on the 8th, and closes with the remark that he was
