                <p>That your petitioner's claim to the service or labor of said <seg type="handwritten"><persName>Mary Jane Brooks</persName></seg> was, at the

                        as may enhance the same, and also such facts, if any, touching the moral,
                        mental, and bodily infirmities or defects of said person, as impair the

                        petitioner specify no such infirmity or defect, then his statement touching
                        the value of his claim should conclude with an averment that he has no

                        that the said <persName>Mary Jane</persName> has any defect which might
                        impair the value of her service in any manner. That she is an excellent
                        house servant and cook; careful intelligent, honest, trustworthy and of
                        great diligence and industry—</seg></p>


                <p>Your petitioner hereby declares that <seg type="handwritten">she</seg> bears true
                    and faithful allegiance to the Government of the <placeName>United

                    arms against the <placeName>United States</placeName> in the present rebellion,
                    nor in any way given aid or comfort thereto.</p>

                <p>And your petitioner further states and alleges, that <seg type="handwritten">she</seg> has not brought said <seg type="handwritten"><persName>Mary Jane

                    and by virtue of your petitioner's claim to such service or labor.</p>

                <p>Your petitioner further states and alleges, that <seg type="handwritten">her</seg> said claim to the service or labor of said <seg type="handwritten"><persName>Mary Jane</persName></seg> does not
                    originate in or by virtue of any transfer heretofore made by any person who has

                        her knowledge or belief—</seg></p>

                <p>And your petitioner prays the said Commissioners to investigate and determine the

                    herein above set forth; and if the same be found to be valid, that they appraise
