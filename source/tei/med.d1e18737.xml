                                                  Washington. When admitted, he was suffering
                                                  intense pain in the chest; retention of urine and

                                                  painful; pulse, 100. Cold water dressings were
                                                  applied, and opiates administered. He died on <date type="death" when="1864-07-15">July

                                                  directly over the center of the left clavicle,
                                                  made, apparently, by a bullet, but, on attempting
                                                  to introduce the finger, it was found to be
                                                  closed. The first rib was fractured at its
                                                  greatest curvature, but was not entirely broken
                                                  across. There was one hundred and eight ounces of
                                                  bloody fluid in the thoracic cavity. The right
                                                  lung, with the exception of a few recent adhesions
                                                  on the posterior aspect of the lower lobe, was
                                                  healthy. The left lung had a hole through
                                                  it about one inch from the apex, through which the
                                                  finger could be introduced. It was very much
                                                  compressed by the fluid. The ball entered at the
                                                  attachment of the rib to the third dorsal
                                                  vertebra, the left transverse process of which it
                                                  fractured, and was found lying against the left
                                                  lamina of the fourth dorsal vertebra, which it had
                                                  fractured from its pedicle, and by pushing it
                                                  outward and backward had fractured the lamina of
                                                  the opposite side and the spinous process. The
                                                  pathological specimen is numbered 2343, Section I,
