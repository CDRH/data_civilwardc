                                                  was introduced. The parts were very little swollen                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          
                                                  and not very painful. The patient reacted
                                                  promptly. Interrupted sutures were inserted,
                                                  adhesive strips and cold water dressings applied,
                                                  opiates administered, and stimulants and
                                                  nutritious diet ordered. There was no apparent
                                                  change in the patient s condition after the
                                                  operation.  Coma supervened, and death occurred
                                                                <date type="death" when="1864-06-18">June 18th, 1864</date>. </p>
