                <p>That your petitioner's claim to the service or labor of said <seg type="handwritten"><persName>Harriet Williams</persName></seg> was, at the
                    time of said discharge therefrom, of the value of <seg type="handwritten">, one

                        petitioner specify no such infirmity or defect, then his statement touching
                        the value of his claim should conclude with an averment that he has no

                <p>Your petitioner hereby declares that <seg type="handwritten">She</seg> bears true
                    and faithful allegiance to the Government of the <placeName>United

                    arms against the <placeName>United States</placeName> in the present rebellion,

                <p>And your petitioner further states and alleges, that <seg type="handwritten">She</seg> has not brought said <seg type="handwritten"><persName>Harriet

                            Williams</persName></seg> was held to service or labor therein under and
                    by virtue of your petitioner's claim to such service or labor.</p>

                <p>Your petitioner further states and alleges, that <seg type="handwritten">her</seg> said claim to the service or labor of said <seg type="handwritten"><persName>Harriet Williams</persName></seg> does not
                    originate in or by virtue of any transfer heretofore made by any person who has

                    the <placeName>United States</placeName>.</p>

                <p>And your petitioner prays the said Commissioners to investigate and determine the

                    herein above set forth; and if the same be found to be valid, that they appraise
                    and apportion the value of said claim in money, and report the same to the
                    Secretary of the Treasury of the <placeName>United States</placeName>, in
