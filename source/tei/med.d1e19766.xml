                                                  8th, 1863</date>; one ball entered the left side of the

                                                  and emerged eight and one-half inches posterior to
                                                  the wound of entrance, and three ribs lower down,
                                                  fracturing the seventh rib anterior to its angle.
                                                  The second ball entered on a level with the tenth
                                                  rib, passed from behind forward, and fractured the

                                                  of the cartilage with the bone. He was conveyed to

On admission, he was very pale and anæmic and suffered greatly from his wounds; no
                                                  emphysema of surrounding integument. Respiration
                                                  40 per minute, short and labored. Cough harassing,
                                                  though no sputa was brought up. No difference in
                                                  measurement existed between the two sides of the
                                                  chest; pulse, 108; sleeps poorly; orthopnœa
                                                  prominent. September 17th: It was observed that,
                                                  in addition to the empyema which was present on
                                                  the left side, a violent pleurisy had attacked the
                                                  right. The combined sources of depression rapidly
                                                  exhausted the remaining vital power of the
                                                  patient. On the 20th, several spiculæ of bone
                                                  were removed from the wound of exit. The coughing
                                                  would occasionally cause large quantities of
                                                  purulent matter to be discharged from the wound.
                                                  The person and surroundings of the patient became
                                                  offensive in the extreme, rendering him a pitiable
                                                  object. On the 25th, pericarditis was detected. At
                                                  this time, he presented the following symptoms:
                                                  orthopnœa; sits up in bed with head-frame behind
                                                  him; respiration 45 per minute and laborious;
                                                  face expressive of great exhaustion, pallid;
                                                  nostrils dilated strongly at every inspiration;
                                                  wild expression of eyes, pupils contracted. Pulse

                                                  seventh, and eighth ribs. The specimen shows firm
                                                  pleuritic adhesions. Specimen No. 2243 of the same

                                                  are united. Both specimens were contributed, with
