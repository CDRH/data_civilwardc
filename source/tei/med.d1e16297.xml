He was taken prisoner and conveyed to the <name type="hospital" key="176">Lincoln Hospital</name>, Washington, on <date type="admit" when="1864-07-17">the 17th</date>, being conscious at the time.  On <date type="operation " when="1864-07-27">the 27th</date>, the

                                                  the patient's pulse full and regular.  Convulsions,

                                                  lying upon the brain substance. An abscess existed
                                                  about the size of an English walnut. The brain
                                                  substance of the right lobe was much softened and
                                                  congested, and the ventricles were filled with
                                                  serous fluid.  The vault of the cranium was
                                                  preserved, and is figured in the wood-cut.
                                                  Fragments have been removed from an elliptical
                                                  space, measuring one by one and one-fourth inches.
                                                  The posterior half of the sagittal suture is
                                                  separated, and five fissures radiate from the
