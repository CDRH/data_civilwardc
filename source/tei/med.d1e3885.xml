                                                Mich.</name>; age 22; was admitted <date type="admit" when="1861-09-06">Sept. 6, 1861</date>.
                                        Diagnosis—typhoid fever. This patient had good
                                        health up to <date type="injury" when="1861-08-26">August 26</date>, when he was taken with pain in the
                                        head and bones, chills and fever, somnolence, great thirst
                                        and epistaxis. His case was not taken up in detail until the
                                        13th, when the morning record shows him to have rested well
                                        during the preceding night; he was very weak but had some
                                        appetite, regular bowels, a thickly coated brown tongue, a
                                        pulse beating 98 per minute and a slight cough; the evening
                                        record shows a white tongue, bad taste in the mouth, some
                                        fever, bowels regular, abdomen tender and slightly
                                        tympanitic, cough, tinnitus aurium and muscæ
                                        volitantes. On the 14th anorexia was added to the symptoms
                                        already stated. Next day he became dull, complained of
                                        heaviness over the eyes, and in the evening seemed drowsy.
                                        On the evening of the 16th the tongue became moist and
                                        white, but this was not followed by any general improvement;
                                        on the contrary, on the evening of the 17th the fever
                                        increased with slight nausea, the pulse running up to 106,
                                        while next day a pain on deep inspiration was developed. But
                                        on the 19th the pulse again fell to 92 and the skin became
                                        moist and sweating. There was some tenderness in the
                                        epigastrium on the 20th, in the hypochondrium on the 22d and
                                        in the right iliac region on the 23d, in addition to the
                                        abdominal tenderness which had existed from the time of
                                        admission. On the 21st the patient became somewhat deaf in
                                        the left ear, and next day his eyes became dull. The
                                        abdominal tenderness was relieved on the 24th, when, also,
                                        the tongue began to clean in patches, but thirst continued
                                        until the 27th. The patient slept badly on the night of the
                                        24th, the only night which furnished such a record, for
                                        usually he rested well, and next morning his pulse was 96
                                        and he had a soreness in the chest. On the 26th the tongue
                                        was moist and only slightly coated, which improvement was
                                        followed next day by a brightening of the eyes, abatement of
                                        the thirst and a return of the appetite. The bowels, which
                                        to this time had remained quiet rather than lax, now became
                                        loose, giving two, three or four stools daily, with iliac
                                        tenderness and a yellow fur upon the tongue; but in progress
                                        of time this diarrhœa abated and on <date type="transfer" when="1861-11-01">November 1</date>
                                        the patient was transferred to <name type="place">Annapolis, Md.</name>, whence he was
                                        returned to duty on <date type="duty" when="1861-11-13">the 13th</date>. He was treated at first with Dover's
                                        powder and sweet spirit of nitre, and afterwards, on the
                                        23d, with turpentine emulsion and iron, opium, acetate of
                                        lead and tannin. </p>
