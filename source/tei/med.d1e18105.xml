On <date type="injury" when="1864-05-27">May 27th</date>, a copious secondary hæmorrhage occurred from the mouth,
                                                  which was arrested by the persulphate of iron,
                                                  pressure, cold applications, and an elevated
                                                  position. Extra diet was given. The patient died
                                                  on <date type="death" when="1864-06-04">June 4th, 1864</date>. At the autopsy, it was found fractured half way between the angle and the
                                                  symphysis. The jugular vein just above the middle
                                                  of the omo-hyoid muscle was found discolored,
                                                  shriveled, closed, and, apparently, in a sloughy
                                                  condition, and filled with coagulum for two inches
                                                  below the wound. The hæmorrhage was evidently
                                                  from this vein. The specimens are No. 2440, Sect. I, A. M. M. (two fragments, being the right half
                                                  of the inferior maxilla), and 2441, Sect. I, A. M. M. (a wet preparation of a portion of the right
