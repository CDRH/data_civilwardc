V. Walking</name>, of <name type="place">Newbury, Vermont</name>, reported, <date type="pension" when="1872-09-13">September 13, 1872</date>, that "the wounds [meaning, probably, the cicatrized sinuses connected with them] were situated as follows: One immediately through the os pubis, and also through the bladder, coming out on the left side of the backbone; one through the left testicle, and passing out also on the left side of the spine; one through the left groin, passing through the rectum; and another in the right inner thigh. The disability consists in great irritability of the bladder, with pain in that region; an inability to retain the urine, in consequence of permanent contraction and a chronic inflammation of the neck of the bladder; also a weakness of the rectum or paralysis resulting from the passing through of the ball, very much impairing the functions of that portion of the bowels; and a loss of use of the right leg from the wound in the thigh. Finally, he has frequent calls to urinate, attended with very severe pain, especially after taking exercise or cold, and at such times is obliged to take to his bed. He has defective circulation and symptoms of paralysis." <name type="person" key="xxx">Examiner J. F. Burns</name>, of <name type="place">Brainerd, Minnesota</name>, reported, <date type="pension" when="1873-09-10">September 10, 1873</date>, the injuries as described, and adds: "He cannot retain his urine, and has to use a bougie to keep the bowels open, and has partial paralysis of both legs; his disability is total."  He was last paid to <date type="pension" when="1873-06-04">June 4, 1873</date>.</p>
