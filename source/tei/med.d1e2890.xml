                                                1861</date>. He stated that he had been sick since
                                        June, when he had an attack of enteric fever. On admission
                                        he had headache and was anxious looking, his eyes dull,
                                        cheeks flushed, pulse 90, quick and feeble, skin hot and
                                        dry, tongue slightly moist, red at the tip and edges, black
                                        and fissured in the centre; his appetite was fair. Dover's
                                        powder was prescribed. Next day he was reported as having
                                        had four movements of the bowels; his tongue had become
                                        white in the centre and his skin covered profusely with an eruption the character of which is
                                        not stated. Punch and tincture of iron were given. The
                                        eruption is mentioned on the following day and again on the
                                        21st. During the progress of the case the bowels were
                                        relaxed, two stools being passed daily. The appetite
                                        continued good until the day of death. There was great
                                        tenderness in the abdomen, which was at first especially
                                        marked in the left iliac region, but afterwards became
                                        associated with various regions as the epigastric,
                                        umbilical, the track of the transverse and descending colon
                                        and on one occasion the right side; the tenderness was
                                        usually accompanied by meteorism and gurgling. The skin was
                                        hot and dry throughout except on one or two days, when it was
                                        reported as very dry but not hot. The tongue was dry, red,
                                        fissured and glazed, the lips covered with sordes and the
                                        teeth with tenacious mucus. On the l6th there was some
                                        headache with occasional delirium of a mild character, which
                                        afterwards became more continuous. On the 23d the patient is
                                        reported as having slept well as usual; his countenance was
                                        pale, face pinched, lips parched, skin and tongue dry, pulse
                                        95 and feeble, the abdomen flat. Turpentine emulsion,
                                        cod-liver oil and quinine were prescribed. He died <date type="death" when="1861-10-23">during
