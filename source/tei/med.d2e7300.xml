The missile was extracted on <date type="operation" when="1862-12-18">December 18th</date>, being found to have
     moulded itself to the cylindrical form of the shaft of the bone. The patient's general health
     was good. Simple dressings were applied to the wound. On February 11, 1863, the bone was found
     to be re-covered with periosteum excepting a very small portion, and the wound was allowed to
     close. On <date type="injury" when="1863-02-20">February 20th</date> it had healed; but, on this day, erysipelas set in, spreading rapidly,
     and invading the whole leg and the body to the umbilicus. The leg swelled enormously and
     vesicated over a large portion of its surface, the cellular tissues being distended with serum.
     Punctures being made, several quarts of serum were discharged. By April 22d the patient had
     recovered, though he was still debilitated, and there was yet some enlargement. He was
     discharged from service <date type="servicedischarge" when="1863-05-09">May 9, 1863</date>, by reason
