Chronic diarrhœa.  [This man appears on the register of the depot hospital of the 2d Corps, <name type="place">City Point, Virginia</name>, admitted <date type="admit" when="1864-11-18">November 18th</date>—acute diarrhœa—sent to general hospital <date type="transfer" when="1864-11-29">November 29th</date>, per steamer State of Maine.]  Treated with astringents, tonics, anodynes and stimulants.

The thoracic cavity contained a small quantity of bloody serum. There were firm pleuritic adhesions on the right side. The lower lobe of the right lung was hepatized. About eight ounces of serum were found in the abdominal cavity. The liver was brownish on section, and exuded a good deal of bloody serosity. The spleen was of medium size and purplish. The mucous membrane of the jejunum and ileum was inflamed and softened in patches; the solitary glands were enlarged and ulcerated. The cæcum and rectum were ulcerated in spots. The hemorrhoidal veins were enlarged.</p> 
   <p>⃰ It is to be regretted that, in most instances, the records of this hospital do not show by whom the autopsies were made. It is known that many of them were made by <name type="person" key="134">Surgeon Bentley</name> himself, or under his immediate supervision, but it is only possible to distinguish these from the others in a few cases.</p>
