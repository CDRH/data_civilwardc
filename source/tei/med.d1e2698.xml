                                        Diagnosis—typhoid fever. On <date type="injury" when="1861-10-09">October 9</date> he had pain
                                        in the bowels but no diarrhœa, pain in the chest
                                        and cough with rusty sputa. On the 27th he had a chill
                                        followed by some fever, but without headache or confusion of
                                        mind, epistaxis or diarrhœa. On admission the skin
                                        was husky, tongue dry and smooth, teeth blackened, pulse 80;
                                        there was difficulty of swallowing from soreness of the
                                        fauces; he had two thin yellowish stools with acute
                                        tenderness in the right iliac region, but no tympanites nor
                                        gurgling; he had little appetite and was very weak; some
                                        cough was also present. Turpentine emulsion and
                                        whiskey-punch were prescribed. Next day he had soreness in
                                        the bones, occasional dizziness and mental <choice><orig>dulness</orig><reg>dullness</reg></choice>. On
                                        November 1 the tongue became moist, clean at the tip and
                                        edges but covered with a grayish fur at the base; on this
                                        day he expectorated some blood. There was some headache on
                                        the 2d; but the patient slept well on the 3d, and next day
                                        there was moisture and sudamina on the skin, while the
                                        tongue had again become dry and brown and there was much
                                        abdominal tenderness; two stools were obtained on this day
                                        by means of castor oil. The tongue on the 6th became again
                                        moist and clean at the tip and edges and the skin dry; two
                                        offensive stools were passed; there was some cough and the
                                        respirations at this time were increased to 31 per minute;
                                        two rose-colored spots were discovered on the chest. The
                                        record gives no further details, closing with the statement
                                        that the patient was returned to duty on <date type="duty" when="1861-12-01">December 1</date>. </p>
