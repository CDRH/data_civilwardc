                                                  the lower extremities, both as to sensation and
                                                  motion. He did not complain of any great amount of
                                                  pain. His appetite was good. There was no movement
                                                  of the bowels, except as the effect of a
                                                  cathartic, and his urine had to be drawn
                                                  regularly, otherwise it passed involuntarily from
                                                  him upon the bladder becoming partly full. The
                                                  muscles of the thigh and legs twitched
                                                  involuntarily. Blisters were ordered to the spine
                                                  in the neighborhood of the second dorsal vertebra,
                                                  which was dislocated. <date type="injury" when="1864-02-10">February 10th</date>: Counter
                                                  irritation has been thoroughly tried, with no good
                                                  result. Bed sores formed on each hip, although an
                                                  astringent wash had been used and pressure
                                                  prevented as far as possible, and it was feared
                                                  that the vitality of the parts was so low as to
                                                  prevent their healing. Patient sank gradually; his
                                                  appetite became poor; bed sores worse, and the
                                                  discharge from them very abundant and offensive.
                                                  Death resulted on <date type="death" when="1864-04-28">April 28th, 1864</date>. At the

                                                  viscera was found apparently healthy; there was
                                                  pressure upon the cord at the point of dislocation of the vertebral column and effusion within
                                                  the membranes. The pathological specimen is No.
