There was not much bleeding, but great tympanitic distension, which subsided on the tenth day, and was followed by an abscess of the liver. This was incised anteriorly, on <date type="operation" when="1863-07-13">July 13th</date>, and a profusion of pus was evacuated.  The patient was supported by a sustaining regimen, and, on August 2nd, was sufficiently convalescent to bear transportation to the <name type="hospital" key="512">3d division hospital</name> at <name type="place">Alexandria</name>. The wound had healed, but he was very weak. He improved rapidly, and was returned to duty on <date type="duty" when="1863-10-07">October 7, 1863</date>; but, being unfit for active service, he was sent to <name type="hospital" key="171">Armory Square Hospital</name> on <date type="admit" when="1864-03-20">March 20, 1864</date>. A ventral hernia had protruded at the site of the cicatrix. </p>
