     Williams</name>, <name type="organization" key="465">Co. F, 136th Pennsylvania</name>, aged 45

     Nordquist</name>, <name type="organization" key="431">83d New York</name>, reported his
    admission to the field hospital of the 2d division, First Corps, with "shot wound of right leg."
     <name type="person" key="102">Surgeon O. A. Judson</name>, <name type="organization" key="132">U. S. V.</name>, contributed the pathological specimen with the following description: "The
    wound was caused by a minié ball entering the upper part of the middle third of the tibia,
    passing obliquely downward and backward, fracturing the bone in its course and wounding the
    anterior tibial artery, and emerging through the gastrocnemius muscle. The patient was admitted
    to <name type="hospital" key="167">Carver Hospital</name>, Washington, <date type="admit" when="1862-12-21">December 21st</date>. The leg was placed in a fracture box and the bone kept
    well in apposition. Water dressings were applied. The patient progressed favorably until <date type="operation" when="1862-12-28">December 28th</date>, when a profuse and continually
    recurring hæmorrhage set in which resisted ordinary measures for its control. Amputation
    was accordingly resorted to, and performed at the upper third of the leg by flap operation. On
     <date type="operation" when="1863-01-01">Januray 1, 1863</date>, hæmorrhage to the amount
    of thirty ounces occurred from the anterior tibial artery in the stump, which was laid open and
    the bleeding vessel was secured. But the patient gradually sank, and died the <date type="death" when="1863-01-01">evening of the same day</date>. His system was also infected with
    pyæmia. Examination revealed an oblique fracture of the tibia, also that a piece of bone
    had been driven into the anterior tibial artery. The inter-muscular tissues of the limb were
    distended by pus." The wood-cut (<hi rend="initialcap">F</hi>IG. 299) is a representation of the
    amputated shaft of the tibia (<hi rend="italic">Spec</hi>. 634), which was comminuted in the
    middle third but shows very little displacement of fragments. </p>
