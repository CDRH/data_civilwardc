                                since <date type="injury" when="1861-09-21">September 21</date> with
                                pain in the head, back and limbs, and diarrhœa. Quinine had
                                been taken. On the day after admission he was looking natural
                                although his face was somewhat congested; pulse 100, full and
                                strong; skin hot and moist; tongue moist, white at the edges, dry
                                and brown in the centre; he had some headache and abdominal
                                tenderness. Spirit of nitre, camphor and tincture of iron were
                                ordered. A six-grain dose of blue-pill was given on the following
                                day, and repeated on the 4th, with two grains of extract of
                                colocynth. On this day there was some delirium; the tongue was moist
                                and yellow coated and the skin covered with perspiration. This was
                                followed by frequent stools on the 5th, but the diarrhœa did
                                not persist. During the remainder of the patient's sickness the
                                bowels were moved twice daily for two weeks and once daily
                                thereafter to the termination of the record. Rose-spots appeared on
                                the chest on the 6th, the tongue became red at the margins and
                                brown-coated in the centre, and there was slight tenderness in the
                                right iliac region. More rose-spots erupted on the 8th; the tongue
                                became dry, red and cracked, and there was tenderness in the left
                                iliac and umbilical regions with borborygmus. On the 11th a few
                                rose-spots appeared. On this day turpentine emulsion was prescribed.
                                Delirium returned on the 13th and continued at times until the 18th,
                                during which time the tongue, skin and pulse were unaltered,
                                although a slight cough was developed. But on the 18th the tongue
                                became slightly moist, and next day it was moist and clean, the
                                pulse 72, regular, the skin of natural temperature although still
                                showing some rose-colored spots, the appetite good, the abdomen
                                tender and tympanitic over the transverse colon. Some rose-spots
                                appeared on the 24th. On the 30th the patient was dressed and
                                sitting up. On <date type="transfer" when="1861-11-01">November
