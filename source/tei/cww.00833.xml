                        then his statement touching the value of his claim should conclude with an
                        averment that he has no knowledge of any such infirmity or

                    under and by virtue of your petitioner's claim to such service or labor.</p>

                <p>Your petitioner further states and alleges, that <seg type="handwritten">her</seg> said claim to the service or labor
                    of said <seg type="handwritten">persons</seg> does not
