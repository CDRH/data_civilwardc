                                        was headache and deafness, tinnitus and hebetude; the face
                                        was congested; pulse 78; the tongue was dry, swollen and
                                        coated yellow; the patient had no appetite, much thirst,
                                        relaxed bowels and some tympanites and abdominal tenderness;
                                        profuse sweating had occurred during the night, and on the
                                        chest and abdomen a few rose-colored spots were discovered.
                                        On the 3d sordes appeared on the teeth, and on the 4th
                                        delirium supervened, the patient making frequent attempts to
                                        leave his bed; the tongue became red at the tip and edges.
                                        There was less deafness, and the mind became clearer on the
                                        6th, but the delirium did not entirely subside until the
                                        11th. Onthe 16th the tongue was clean, pulse 75, and there
                                        was no abdominal tenderness. The case was treated from the
                                        3d with milk-punch, beef-essence and emulsion of turpentine.
