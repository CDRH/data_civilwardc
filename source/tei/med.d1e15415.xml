                    depressed portions elevated. No anæsthetic was used. The patient rallied and
                    became partially sensible; strabismus disappeared before morning.  On the second
                    day after the operation, his pulse was 76, appetite fair, but the mind rather
                    slow. On the 1st of January, 1863, he was a little giddy and complained of
                    slight headache, but was otherwise improving rapidly.  He was transferred to the
                        <name type="organization" key="644">Invalid Corps</name> on <date type="transfer" when="1863-05-17">May 17th, 1863</date>.  He is not a
