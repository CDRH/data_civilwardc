                                                  from which it was removed on the field. He was
                                                  conveyed to Washington, and, on <date type="admit" when="1864-05-12">the 12th</date>, admitted

                                                  wound, May 13th, some pieces of bone were removed,
                                                  and the finger could be passed deeply into the
                                                  cerebral substance. Paralysis of the left side
                                                  ensued, and, at times, involuntary discharge of
                                                  the fæces and urine occurred. The tongue was
                                                  drawn to the left or paralyzed side. Hernia
                                                  cerebri appeared, the protruding part occasionally
                                                  becoming strangulated and sloughing. The patient
                                                  retained the possession of his mental faculties in
                                                  a remarkable degree, answering all questions
                                                  addressed to him with accuracy. Death supervened
                                                  on <date type="death" when="1864-06-20">June 20th, 1864</date>, forty-one days after the
                                                  reception of the injury. At the autopsy, the
                                                  fractured portion of the outer table was found to
                                                  measure two inches in length by one in width;
                                                  that of the inner table somewhat less. Two small
                                                  fragments of the inner, and two of the outer,
                                                  remained; the rest had been removed. The
                                                  surrounding bone was cribriform and slightly
                                                  carious, and the edges rounded off, showing an
                                                  attempt at repair. No evidence of meningeal
                                                  inflammation existed; there was, however,
                                                  extensive softening of the right hemisphere,
                                                  involving the thalamus optiens and corpus striatum; the lateral ventricles were filled with serum.
                                                  The case is reported by <name type="person" key="200">Assistant Surgeon William Thomson</name>, <name type="organization" key="190">U. S. A.</name>
