        by a conoidal musket ball, which passed through the zygoma and squamous portion of the left
        temporal bone and penetrated the brain. He was admitted into the hospital of the Second
        Corps at <name type="place">City Point</name> on <date type="admit" when="1864-08-16">the
          16th</date>, being delirious at the time. On <date type="operation" when="1864-08-17"><date type="transfer" when="1864-08-17">the following day</date></date>, he was
        forwarded by hospital steamer to <name type="place" key="#Washington">Washington</name>, and
        admitted to the <name type="hospital" key="172">Emory Hospital</name> in a comatose
        condition. His right side was paralyzed, pulse feeble and 105 per minute, and extensive
        ecchymosis existed around each eye. There was considerable laceration of the soft parts and
        extensive comminution of bone. The brain protruded and discharged from the opening.
        Chloroform was administered, and <name type="person" key="884">Surgeon N. R. Moseley</name>,
          <name type="organization" key="132">U. S. V.</name>, removed the ball and several
        spiculæ of bone, which had been forced into the brain. Cold water dressings were
        applied, and the patient was placed on the injured side to promote discharge. Calomel and
        strict antiphlogistic treatment were ordered, but death supervened on <date type="death" when="1864-08-19">August 19th, 1864</date>. An autopsy showed extensive laceration of
        anterior and middle lobes of brain. The ball had passed through a portion of pons varolii
        and the crura cerebelli of left side. The brain was considerably congested. The pathological
        specimen, represented by the wood-cut, shows a fragment of the squamous portion of the left
        temporal, with a conoidal ball half severed by the edge of the fractured bone. The fragments
        include one square inch of surface. The specimen was contributed by the operator, <name type="person" key="884">Surgeon N. R. Moseley</name>, <name type="organization" key="132">U. S. V.</name>
