                                                  entered the right side of the thorax, between the
                                                  sixth and seventh ribs, two and a half inches
                                                  below the nipple and two inches from the sternum,
                                                  remaining in the body. He was taken to the Cavalry
                                                  Corps Hospital, Army of the Potomac, and,
                                                  on <date type="transfer" when="1863-06-24">June 24th</date>, transferred to <name type="hospital" key="176">Lincoln Hospital</name>,
                                                  Washington. The wound of entrance soon healed. An
                                                  examination revealed the presence of fluid in
                                                  small quantity in the left pleural cavity, with
                                                  compression of the lower lobe of the lung. He did
                                                  not complain of pain in the side, which varied
                                                  very slightly in circumference to that of the
                                                  right. The scapula of that side was almost
                                                  motionless on respiration. Cough moderate; sputa
                                                  none. He was troubled with a persistent diarrhœa,
                                                  which assumed almost the same characteristic as
                                                  the ordinary chronic diarrhœa, being accompanied
                                                  with extreme emaciation, abdominal pain,
                                                  scantiness of the secretions, and capricious
                                                  appetite. In the latter part of November, the
                                                  patient commenced to sink. A severe cough came on.
                                                  Expectoration became profuse and sputa very
                                                  offensive. Orthopnæa marked. His mind, however,
                                                  was clear. The diarrhœa increased in violence.
                                                  About <date type="injury" when="1863-12-01">December 1st</date>, the person of the patient
                                                  became very offensive. Delirium set in. Death
                                                  supervened on <date type="death" when="1863-12-09">December 9th, 1863</date>. The autopsy
                                                  showed the posterior portion of the right lung
                                                  much compressed; the third lobe was carnified and
                                                  the posterior portion of the lung covered with a
                                                  thick layer of roughened lymph; between this and
                                                  the pleura costalis was found one quart and two
                                                  ounces of dark and offensive pus. The liver was
