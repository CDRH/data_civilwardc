                    <name type="organization" key="331">Co. H, 82d Pennsylvania Volunteers, of the
                    3d Brigade, 1st Division, 6th Corps</name>, aged 21 years, received, in an
                encounter with the enemy's cavalry near <name type="place">Burke's Station,
                    Virginia</name>, on <date type="injury" when="1865-04-06">April 6th,
                1865</date>, two sabre-cuts over the vertex, parallel to each other, and at right
                angles to the sagittal suture. The wounds appeared to implicate the scalp only, and
                were approximated by adhesive plaster, after the hair had been shaven away. The
                patient was conveyed to Washington, and entered <name type="hospital" key="173">Harewood Hospital</name> on <date type="admit" when="1865-04-16">April
                    16th</date>. The wounds healed rapidly, and no unpleasant symptoms occurred
                until <date when="1865-04-16">May 29th</date>, when he complained of severe
                headache, accompanied by intolerance of light and sensitiveness to noise. A day or
                two subsequently the anterior wound reopened, and discharged thin unhealthy pus. An
                exfoliation was suspected, but no denuded bone could be detected, and under a mild
                evaenant treatment the headache subsided, and the wound again assumed an healthy
                aspect. On <date type="discharge" when="1865-06-08">June 8th, 1865</date>, it had
                almost entirely healed, and, at his own request, the patient was discharged from the
                hospital and from the service of the United States. Soon after his admission to
                Harewood, a photograph of his wounds had been taken, by direction of the surgeon in
                charge, <name type="person" key="158">Brevet Lieut. Col. R. B. Bontecou</name>,
                    <name type="organization" key="132">U. S. Vols</name>. This is preserved as No.
                30 of the first volume of Photographs of Surgical Cases, <name type="hospital" key="431">Army Medical Museum</name>, and is very faithfully copied in the
                figure on the left of the group of heads in the accompanying plate.</p>
