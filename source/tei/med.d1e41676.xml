[This man appears on the register of the field hospital of the 2d Division, 2d Corps, admitted <date type="admit" when="1864-11-15">November 15th</date>—dropsy; no disposition; and on the register of the depot hospital of the 2d Corps, <name type="place">City Point, Virginia</name>, admitted <date type="admit" when="1864-11-26">November 26th</date>—diarrhœa—sent to general hospital <date type="transfer" when="1864-11-29">November 29th</date>, per steamer State of Maine.]  The patient was considerably emaciated, and much exhausted by the journey. He had little or no appetite, and complained of frequent bloody stools accompanied by abdominal pain and tenesmus.  ℞. Oil of turpentine, tincture of opium and castor oil, each one drachm, powdered gum Arabic two drachms, water five ounces. Take a tablespoonful every three hours.  This relieved the tenesmus, and the blood disappeared from the stools. During the first half of December he appeared to be improving; his bowels, however, remained loose, his stomach became irritable, he complained of soreness and dryness of the pharynx; a low form of bronchitis supervened, the skin became harsh and dry, and at times the extremities were œdematous. Brandy-punch and beef-essence were freely administered, as well as opiates and astringents, but without benefit. There was no cerebral difficulty at any time. He gradually failed, and died <date type="death" when="1864-12-30">December 30th</date>, at 2 A. M.  <hi rend="italic">Autopsy</hi> <date type="autopsy" when="1864-12-30">eight hours after death</date>: There was some engorgement of the posterior part of the lungs, and some bronchial inflammation. The heart was fatty. The liver presented the nutmeg appearance. The kidneys were small and fatty. The colon was ulcerated, particularly in the neighborhood of the ileo-cæcal valve.</p> 
   <p>⃰ It is to be regretted that, in most instances, the records of this hospital do not show by whom the autopsies were made. It is known that many of them were made by <name type="person" key="134">Surgeon Bentley</name> himself, or under his immediate supervision, but it is only possible to distinguish these from the others in a few cases.</p>
