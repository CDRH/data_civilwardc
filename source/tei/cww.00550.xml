            <div1 type="petition" subtype="handwritten">
                <p>To the Commissioners under the act of Congress approved <date when="1862-04-16">April 16th, 1862</date>, entitled "An act for the release of certain
                    persons held to service or labor in the <placeName>District of
                        Columbia</placeName>."</p>

                <p>Your Petitioner <persName>Alfred H. Boucher</persName> of <placeName>Georgetown
                        D.C.</placeName> by this his petition in writing represents and states that
                    he is a person loyal to the <placeName>United States</placeName> who at the time
                    of the passage of the Act of Congress aforesaid held a claim to service or labor
                    against one person of African descent of the name of <persName>Lucien
                        Jones</persName> for and during the life of the said <persName>Lucien
                        Jones</persName>—; and that by said Act of Congress said
                        <persName>Lucien Jones</persName> was discharged and freed of and from all
                    claim of your petitioner to such service or labor; that at the time of said
                    discharge said <persName>Lucien Jones</persName> was of the age of 35 years and
                    of the personal description following viz: about 5 feet 10 inches high, of light
                    brown color, very straight and able-bodied</p>

                <p>That your petitioner acquired his title to the aforesaid service or labor of said
                        <persName>Lucien Jones</persName>, in manner following namely by purchase of
                        <persName>Mrs. Saunders</persName> in <placeName>Georgetown D.C.</placeName>
                    in the year <date when="1851">1851</date> for Eight hundred dollars &amp; that
                    he has mislaid the bill of sale, which was once in his possession</p>

                <p>That your petitioner's claim to the service or labor of said <persName>Lucien
                        Jones</persName> was at the time of said discharge therefrom of the value of
                    Fourteen Hundred dollars in money (that <persName>Thomas Ledan</persName> of
                        <placeName>Montgomery Co, Maryland</placeName>, offered that amount for
                    him): that he is unaware of any mental, moral or bodily defect in said
                        <persName>Lucien Jones</persName> who is healthy, able, bodied has always
                    uniformly been so;</p>

                <p>Your petitioner hereby declares that he bears true &amp; faithful allegiance to
                    the Government of the <placeName>United States</placeName>, and that he has not
                    borne arms against the <placeName>United States</placeName> in the present
                    rebellion, nor in any way given aid or comfort thereto: and further that he has
                    not brought said <persName>Lucien Jones</persName> into the <placeName>District
                        of Columbia</placeName> since the passage of said act; but that at the time
                    of the passage thereof, said <persName>Lucien Jones</persName> was held to
                    service or labor therein under and by virtue of your petitioner's claim to such
                    service or labor: and further that his claim to the said service or labor of
                    said <persName>Lucien Jones</persName> does not originate in or by virtue of any
                    transfer heretofore made by any person who has in any manner aided or sustained
                    the present rebellion against the Government of the <placeName>United
                        States</placeName>.</p>

                <p>Wherefore he prays the said Commissioners to investigate and determine the
                    validity of his said claim to the service or labor of said <persName>Lucien
                        Jones</persName> herein above set forth; and if the same be found to be
                    valid, that they appraise and apportion the value thereof in money and report
                    the same to the Secretary of the Treasury of the <placeName>United
                        States</placeName> in conformity to the provisions of said Act of
                    Congress.</p>
