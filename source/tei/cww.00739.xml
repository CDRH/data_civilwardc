                <p>That your petitioner acquired <seg type="handwritten">her</seg> claim to the

                    <seg type="handwritten"><persName>Julius Cesar Skinner</persName> was purchased

                            <persName>J. D. Hammack</persName> of <placeName>Washington
                            DC.</placeName> Your petitioner purchased said <persName>Julius Cesar

                        aforesaid for the sum of four hundred dollars, as shown by the accompanying
                        bill of sale.</seg></p>

                <p>That your petitioner's claim to the service or labor of said <seg type="handwritten"><persName>Julius Cesar Skinner</persName></seg> was, at
                    the time of said discharge therefrom, of the value of <seg type="handwritten">six hundred</seg> dollars in money.<note type="government" place="foot" xml:id="n3">Here state such facts, if any there be, touching the value of
                        the petitioner's claim to the service or labor of the person, as may enhance
                        the same, and also such facts, if any, touching the moral, mental, and
                        bodily infirmities or defects of said person, as impair the value of the
                        petitioner's claim to such service or labor, and conclude such statement
                        with an averment that the petitioner knows of no other infirmities or
                        defects of said person which impair the value of petitioner's claim to such
                        service or labor, and that he believes none other to exist. If the
                        petitioner specify no such infirmity or defect, then his statement touching
                        the value of his claim should conclude with an averment that he has no
                        knowledge of any such infirmity or defect.</note>
                    <seg type="handwritten">as I was deriving an income of one hundred and twenty
                        dollars per year for his hire at the <placeName>U.S.</placeName> Lunatic
                        Asylum near <placeName>Washington D.C</placeName> where he had been employed
                        for some time as a servant. I also received the same wages for his services,
                        for many months previous at the <placeName>U.S.</placeName> Navy yard in
                        this city. His board also was given in or formed a part of his wages. Your
                        petitioner further avers that said <persName>Julius Cesar Skinner</persName>
                        has no defect of a moral mental or bodily character to the best of her
                        knowledge or belief.</seg></p>

                <p>Your petitioner hereby declares that <seg type="handwritten">she</seg> bears true
                    and faithful allegiance to the Government of the United States, and that <seg type="handwritten">she</seg> has not borne arms against the United States in
                    the present rebellion, nor in any way given aid or comfort thereto.</p>

                <p>And your petitioner further states and alleges, that <seg type="handwritten">she</seg> has not brought said <seg type="handwritten"><persName>Julius
                            Cesar Skinner</persName></seg> into the District of Columbia since the
                    passage of said act of Congress; and that, at the time of the passage thereof,
                    said <seg type="handwritten"><persName>Julius Cesar Skinner</persName></seg> was
                    held to service or labor therein under and by virtue of your petitioner's claim
                    to such service or labor.</p>

                <p>Your petitioner further states and alleges, that <seg type="handwritten">her</seg> said claim to the service or labor of said <seg type="handwritten"><persName>Julius Cesar Skinner</persName></seg> does not
                    originate in or by virtue of any transfer heretofore made by any person who has
                    in any manner aided or sustained the present rebellion against the Government of
                    the United States.</p>

                <p>And your petitioner prays the said Commissioners to investigate and determine the
                    validity of <seg type="handwritten">her</seg> said claim to the service or labor
                    of said <seg type="handwritten"><persName>Julius Cesar Skinner</persName></seg>
                    herein above set forth; and if the same be found to be valid, that they appraise
                    and apportion the value of said claim in money, and report the same to the
                    Secretary of the Treasury of the United States, in conformity to the provisions
                    of said act of Congress.</p>
