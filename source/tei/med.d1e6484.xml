                    complaining of pain in the occipital region. The wound was closed, but it
                    reopened on December 18th. On <date type="operation" when="1863-01-18">January 18th, 1863</date>, a circular portion of dead
                    bone, an inch in diameter, was detected by a probe. The patient had no pain or
                    derangement of the mental faculties, and walked actively about the ward. About
                    February 2d, the discharge from the wound was profuse, and the necrosed bone had
                    not separated. There was no change in his condition until <date type="operation" when="1863-02-25">February 25th</date>, when
                    the exfoliation was observed to be loose, and it was removed by <name type="person" key="xx">Acting Assistant Surgeon J. N. Moore</name> through a crucial incision. The exfoliation consisted of a
                    portion of the external table, an inch in diameter, and several smaller pieces.
                    On <date type="operation" when="1863-03-03">March 3d</date>, yet another piece of the external table was removed. On March 17th,
                    the wound was nearly healed. The patient felt entirely well; and on <date type="servicedischarge" when="1863-05-22">May 22d, 1863</date>, he was
                    discharged from service.  He appears to have had no subsequent trouble, since his
                    name does not appear on the list of applicants for pension.</p>
