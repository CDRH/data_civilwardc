                <p>That your petitioner's claim to the service or labor of said <seg type="handwritten"><persName>Catherine</persName></seg> was, at the time of

                    the time of the passage thereof, said <seg type="handwritten"><persName>Catherine</persName></seg> was held to service or labor
                    therein under and by virtue of your petitioner's claim to such service or
