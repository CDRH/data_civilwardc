                                        1861</date>, having been affected with diarrhœa for
                                        two months. Diagnosis—typhoid fever. He was partly
                                        comatose and difficult to arouse; pulse 80, firm, strong;
                                        face congested; eyes suffused; skin hot and soft; tongue
                                        moist, gray; abdomen tender and bowels moved twice. Calomel
                                        with kino was given. Next day the abdomen and chest were
                                        covered with rose-colored spots; the tongue was moist and
                                        coated, except at the tip and edges, with a rough brown fur;
                                        three stools were passed, and the abdomen was tympanitic and
                                        tender especially in the umbilical region; there was some
                                        purulent expectoration streaked with blood, but not much
                                        cough. No change took place until October 1, when sudamina
                                        appeared on the chest; the stomach became irritable, the
                                        bowels remaining undisturbed. Next day the patient looked
                                        better and had some appetite; his tongue was white at the
                                        tip and edges and brown at the base and centre. Turpentine
                                        emulsion was prescribed on the 4th. Profuse perspiration
                                        occurred on the 5th with sudamina, and on the 9th
                                        rose-colored spots appeared in fresh crops, which by the
                                        11th were very profuse; headache, tinnitus aurium and
                                        deafness affecting the left ear accompanied the eruption,
                                        and the tongue, which had before been flabby and more or
                                        less patched with yellow, became red at the tip and edges
                                        and yellow-coated in the centre; he slept well, however, his
                                        appetite remaining good and his bowels undisturbed. On the
                                        14th he was considered convalescent, and on the <date type="duty" when="1861-10-21">21st</date> was
                                        returned to duty. </p>
