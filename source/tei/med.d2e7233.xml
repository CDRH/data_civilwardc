     wounded at <name type="BATTLE" key="xx">Fredericksburg</name>, <date type="injury" when="1863-05-03">May 3, 1863</date>, and entered <name type="hospital" key="162">Douglas
      Hospital</name>, Washington, <date type="admit" when="1863-05-08">five days afterwards</date>. <name type="person" key="200">Assistant Surgeon W. Thomson</name>, <name type="organization" key="190">U. S. A.</name>, reported: "He
     was struck by a bullet on the outer side of the right thigh. The missile was extracted from below the crest of the ilium on <date type="operation" when="1863-05-14">May 14th</date>, the operation demanding a very extensive incision,
     which was kept freely open to permit the discharge to escape. The femur had been denuded of its periosteum for several inches, the ball evidently having been deflected upward after impinging
     upon that bone. This man recovered, and was transferred to Lovell Hospital, <name type="place">Portsmouth Grove</name>, <date type="transfer" when="1863-07-03">July
       3d</date>." The patient subsequently entered Cony Hospital, <name type="place">Augusta, Maine</name>, whence he was returned to duty <date type="duty" when="1864-10-24">October 24, 1864</date>. On <date type="servicedischarge" when="1865-06-28">June 28, 1865</date>, he was mustered out of service, and subsequently he was admitted on the Pension Roll. The <name type="organization" key="xx">Bangor
      Examining Board</name>, <date type="pension" when="1873-10-04">October 4, 1873</date>, certified to the injury, and adds: "The scar is three
     inches long, and deep, permitting the finger to pass through the fascia and feel roughened
     bone. Slight lameness results." <name type="person" key="xx">Examiner C. Fuller</name>, of
     <name type="place">Lincoln, Maine</name>, reported, <date type="pension" when="1877-10-20">October 20, 1877</date>: "The cicatrix is now so depressed that the little
     finger can be laid in it, and the bone below is a little hollowed, the parts around being very
     tender on pressure. A disagreeable pricking sensation is also produced there on percussion at
     the bottom of the heel." The pensioner was paid <date type="pension" when="1878-12-04">December 4, 1878</date>. The extracted missile, a
     conical ball, was contributed to the <name type="hospital" key="431">Museum</name> by <name type="person" key="200">Assistant Surgeon W. Thomson</name>, and constitutes Specimen 4277 of
     the Surgical Section. </p>
