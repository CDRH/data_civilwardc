                                                Y.</name>; age 21; was admitted <date type="admit" when="1862-02-18">Feb. 18, 1862</date>, having been
                                        sick for some time with chills, headache, pains in back and
                                        limbs, loss of appetite, epistaxis, diarrhœa and
                                        inability to sleep. On March 4 his pulse was recorded as
                                        rapid and weak, skin warm and moist, cheeks flushed, tongue
                                        smooth and natural, abdomen tympanitic and covered with
                                        vibices and a few sudamina; he had little appetite, great
                                        thirst and one or two watery and sometimes involuntary
                                        passages; he was somewhat deaf but appeared sensible;
                                        respiration was hurried and there was some cough. Treatment:
                                        Punch, beef-essence, turpentine emulsion and tincture of
                                        iron, with mustard to the abdomen. From this time he
                                        improved: His watery passages gave place to more natural and
                                        regular discharges,—indeed, on the 10th his bowels
                                        were noted as rather constipated, he slept well, his
                                        appetite returned and his general appearance and strength
                                        seemed improving; but his tongue was considered to be too
                                        smooth, and at times his mind did not appear to be clear. He
                                        was, however, considered as in a fair way to recovery. On
                                        the 15th he complained that his hips were sore from long
                                        continued pressure, and next day that he had lost the sense
                                        of taste—that he could feel his food when in his
                                        mouth but could not taste it. Bed-sores over the sacrum were
                                        noted on the 17th, and great debility with enlarging sores
                                        over the left trochanter on the 26th, on which day also he
                                        was seized with a severe pain in the left side. This pain
                                        increased on the 27th, the breathing becoming hurried and
                                        prostration extreme; his mind was clear, pupils dilated, the
                                        sclerotic showing to an unnatural extent. He died on <date type="death" when="1862-03-27">the 27th</date>,
                                        diarrhœa returning a few hours before death. <hi rend="italic">Post-mortem</hi> examination: The
