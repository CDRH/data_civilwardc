        by a fragment of shell, which produced a comminuted fracture of a portion of the left
        parietal and temporal bones. He was conveyed to <name type="place" key="#Washington">Washington</name>, and on <date type="admit" when="1864-05-14">the 14th</date> admitted
        into the <name type="hospital" key="167">Carver Hospital</name>, suffering constant and
        excruciating pain in the head. He was obliged to lie upon his left side in a recumbent
        position, and remain perfectly quiet. Simple dressings were regularly applied to the wound,
        and a restricted diet enjoined. A hernia cerebri appeared at the seat of fracture.
        Unconsciousness supervened, the breathing became slow and stertorous, and as the coma
        deepened, large quantities of laudable pus were discharged from the wound. He died on <date type="death" when="1864-05-20">the 20th of the month</date>. At the autopsy the fractured
        surface was found to measure three and one-half inches downward and backward, by one-half
        inch in width, from which fragments had been removed. One fissure run from the anterior
        inferior angle of the parietal, nearly to the sagittal suture, and a second crossed the
        lambdoidal. There was no attempt at repair. The specimen is represented in the adjoining
        wood-cut, and was contributed by <name type="person">Acting Assistant Surgeon O. P.
          Sweet</name>.</p>
