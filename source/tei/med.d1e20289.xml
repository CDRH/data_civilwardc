                                                                wounded at <name type="battle" key="xxx">Vienna, Virginia</name>, <date type="injury" when="1863-12-21">December 21st, 1863</date>,
                                                  by a conoidal ball, which entered at a point
                                                  one-half inch in front of and above the left ear.
                                                  He was taken to the field hospital, where the
                                                  wound was examined and search made for the ball. A
                                                  probe could he passed through the point of
                                                  entrance to the condyle of the occipital bone,
                                                  which obstructed and changed the course of the
                                                  ball, it being impossible to trace it further.
                                                  Perfect quiet and rest were enjoined, with the
                                                  expectation that the ball would become encysted.

                                                  rigors commenced, and the patient's life demanded
                                                  that the ball should be found and removed. A probe
                                                  was again introduced to the condyle of the
                                                  occipital bone, a free incision made down to the
                                                  end of the probe, the finger passed downward to
                                                  and under the clavicle, when the ball was found
                                                  resting upon the apex of the lung and was removed.
                                                  The wound healed by granulations, and recovery
                                                  ensued, with paralysis of the facial muscles of
