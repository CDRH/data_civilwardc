An extensive deposit of tubercle was found in the right lung, and there was considerable inflammation of the lung and pleura. The other organs of the chest were healthy. Marked ulceration of lower portion of ileum, cæcum, and colon was observed. The other abdominal organs were healthy.</p> 
   <p>⃰ It is to be regretted that, in most instances, the records of this hospital do not show by whom the autopsies were made. It is known that many of them were made by <name type="person" key="134">Surgeon Bentley</name> himself, or under his immediate supervision, but it is only possible to distinguish these from the others in a few cases.</p>
