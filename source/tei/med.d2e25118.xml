      fall under a horse.</hi>—<name type="person" key="1427">Sergeant D. F. Mansfield</name>,
      <name type="organization" key="538">Co. F, 91st Pennsylvania</name>, aged 37 years, was
     admitted to <name type="hospital" key="173">Harewood Hospital</name>, Washington, <date type="admit" when="1865-01-18">January 18, 1865</date>, suffering from great deformity of the
     right thigh, the result of a simple fracture of the femur at the middle third, the injured
     parts not having been properly adjusted. The injury occurred near the <name type="place">Weldon Railroad</name> <date type="injury" when="1864-11-29">November 29, 1864</date>, by a horse falling upon the man. At
     the time of admission the deformed limb was of no use whatever to the patient and locomotion
     was impeded, although the fractured parts were firmly united. The constitutional state of the
     patient otherwise was good. On <date type="operation" when="1865-01-28">January 28th</date> <name type="person" key="158">Surgeon R. B.
      Bontecou</name>, <name type="organization" key="132">U. S. V.</name>, refractured the limb,
     after which a straight splint and counter-extension were applied. An anæsthetic consisting
     of chloroform and sulphuric ether was used. The patient did well after the operation, the parts
     uniting symmetrically. On March 13th the splint and extension were removed, when the fractured
     parts were found to be firmly united and the limb was placed in a plastic bandage. The patient
     continued to do well. On April 6th the plastic bandage was removed and the patient was allowed
     to be up on crutches, the fractured limb being one and a half inches shorter than the other,
     but firm and of perfect use. The history was reported by <name type="person" key="158">the operator</name>. The patient was
     discharged from service <date type="servicedischarge" when="1865-06-24">June 24, 1865</date>, and
     pensioned.  <name type="person" key="xx">Examining Surgeon O. I. Beach</name>, of <name type="place" key="xx">Parkerville, Kansas</name>, <date type="pension" when="1873-05-19">May 19, 1873</date>, certified to the injury resulting in shortening of the
     limb, and added that there is "displacement of the patella downward, causing much weakness in
     the leg; muscles placid. Complains of constant numbness and occasional severe pain in the leg,
     restricting locomotion," etc.  The pensioner died of consumption <date type="death" when="1875-04-17">April 17, 1875</date>.</p>
