                                                1863</date>, with high fever and delirium, a furred
                                        and fissured tongue, sordes on the teeth, frequent retching
                                        and diarrhœa, the stools numbering about twenty
                                        daily. He was much emaciated and so weak as to be unable to
                                        sit up.  During the next few days his stools became less
                                        frequent, but on the 19th the passages were involuntary, the
                                        delirium continued, the pulse, which had fallen from 120 to
                                        80, was very weak, the countenance pinched, the extremities
                                        cool, the perspiration cold.  He died on <date type="death" when="1863-06-20">the 20th</date>.    <hi rend="italic">Post-mortem</hi> examination <date type="autopsy" when="1863-06-21">fourteen hours after death</date>: The brain was healthy. The mucous
                                        membrane of the œsophagus was of a bright-ochre
                                        color and rather softened; the trachea was of a dark-purple
                                        color, its mucous membrane slightly softened. The lower lobe
                                        of the right lung and the whole of the left lung were
                                        congested. The endocardium was somewhat darkened; the right
                                        ventricle contained a fibrinous clot; the aorta was reddish.
                                        The surface of the liver was generally of a grayish-blue
                                        color, but anteriorly the right lobe presented a more
                                        healthy appearance; minute collections of air were
                                        disseminated throughout the parenchyma of this organ, which
                                        was softened, of the color of sanious pus and possessed of a
                                        disagreeable odor; the air-cavities and the transverse
                                        section of the portal veins gave a honey-combed appearance
                                        to the interior; Glisson's capsule was smooth and easily
                                        torn. The mucous lining of the stomach was of a dark-slate
                                        color but healthy. The spleen, fifteen ounces and a half,
                                        was unusually firm and of a deep mulberry color; the
                                        pancreas was healthy. The intestines were distended with
                                        air; the mucous membrane of the upper portion of the small
                                        intestine was of a light-yellow color; in the lower third
                                        Peyer's patches were ulcerated and the mucous membrane, in
                                        some places very pale, was in others intensely injected; at
                                        the ileo-cæcal valve it was indurated, thickened
                                        and blackened and in the large intestine pale and
                                        irregularly dotted with blackish spots. A cavity containing
                                        about four drachms of pus was found between the peritoneum
                                        and the cellular tissue on the right side of the abdomen,
                                        about two inches below the diaphragm; the omentum was
                                        healthy. The kidneys resembled the liver in having
                                        air-cavities disseminated through their parenchyma; the
                                        distinction between the cortical and pyramidal portions was
                                        almost obliterated, the latter being purplish; the organs
                                        generally were tumid and flabby. Two large bed-sores were
                                        noted, one over the sacrum, the other over the great
                                        trochanter of the right femur.—<hi rend="italic"><name type="person" key="245">Ass't Surg.
