      S. V.</name>, reported:  "The patient was received with gunshot wound of left foot, fracturing
     the first metatarsal bone. Cold-water dressings were applied to the wound and alteratives were
     given internally. This treatment was continued for some weeks, the wound doing well, although
     the patient's constitutional health was very poor. On June 29th stimulants with alteratives
     were ordered, and warm applications were made to the wound, which appeared to be obstinate in
     healing. On July 20th simple cerate dressings were commenced, the wound appearing healthy in
     some parts, though peculiarly unhealthy around the edges; internal treatment continued. One
     month later the wound was erysipelatous in appearance and warm poultices were again applied;
     patient's appetite still good. By September 9th erysipelas and gangrene had invaded the wound
     and creasote was added to the poultice; stimulants given internally. In about ten days
     cold-water dressings were resumed, gangrene having disappeared, but the parts still being
     unhealthy. On September 27th the patient was attacked with chills followed by high fever, when
     antiperiodics and tonics were prescribed and warm applications were again used. Several days
     afterwards the patient began to sink rapidly. He died <date type="death" when="1864-10-03">October 3, 1864</date>, from the effects of irritative fever produced by the unhealthy
     wound."</p>
