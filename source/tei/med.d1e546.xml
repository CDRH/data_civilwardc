Diarrhœa of five weeks standing, with from four to ten passages daily. The patient was emaciated and had no appetite. Rice diet was ordered, perfect rest enjoined, and astringents prescribed—all to little purpose. Ordered the following: ℞. Nitrate of silver ten grains, laudanum twenty-five drops, water one ounce. Use as an enema.  This was retained half an hour, after which the patient went ten hours without a stool. The passages were then altered in character, being thicker and more natural. From time he had only one stool daily. Returned to duty <date type="duty" when="1863-07-20">July 20th</date>.</p>
