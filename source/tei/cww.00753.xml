                <p rend="bold">To the Commissioners under the act of Congress approved the <date when="1862-04-16">16th of April, 1862</date>, entitled "An act for the

                <p>Your Petitioner, <seg type="handwritten"><persName>Caroline

                    petition in writing, represents and states, that <seg type="handwritten">she</seg> is a person loyal to the United States, who, at the time of the
                    passage of the said act of Congress, held a claim to service or labor against
                        <seg type="handwritten">one</seg> person of African descent of the name of
                        <seg type="handwritten"><persName>Rachael Edmonston</persName></seg> for and
                    during the life of said <seg type="handwritten"><persName>Rachael</persName></seg> and that by said act of Congress said
                        <seg type="handwritten"><persName>Rachael</persName> is</seg> discharged and
                    freed of and from all claim of your petitioner to such service or labor; that at
                    the time of said discharge said <seg type="handwritten">
                        <persName>Rachael</persName> was</seg> of the age of <seg type="handwritten">thirty eight years</seg> and of the personal description following:<note type="government" place="foot" xml:id="n1">Here describe the person, so as
                        to identify him or her; and if there be more than one slave, describe each
                        one separately.</note>
                    <seg type="handwritten">about 5 ft in height—dark complexion and stout

                <p>That your petitioner acquired <seg type="handwritten">her</seg> claim to the
                    aforesaid service or labor of said <seg type="handwritten"><persName>Rachael</persName></seg> in manner following:<note type="government" place="foot" xml:id="n2">Here state how the claim was
                        acquired, when, from whom, and for what price or consideration; and, if held
                        under any written evidence of title, make exhibit thereof, or refer to the
                        public record where the same may be found.</note>
                    <seg type="handwritten">By inheritance from her father, by whom
                            <persName>Rachael</persName> was raised from childhood—he having
                        purchased her of the estate of <unclear resp="#el" cert="medium" reason="illegible">Mrs</unclear>
                        <persName>Nancy Middleton</persName> of <placeName>Montgomery Co
                            Md</placeName>; Of which facts she can obtain good and sufficient oral
                        testimony but knows of no other evidences within her reach.</seg></p>

                <p>That your petitioner's claim to the service or labor of said <seg type="handwritten"><persName>Rachael</persName></seg> was, at the time of
                    said discharge therefrom, of the value of <seg type="handwritten">Six
                        hundred</seg> dollars in money.<note type="government" place="foot" xml:id="n3">Here state such facts, if any there be, touching the value of
                        the petitioner's claim to the service or labor of the person, as may enhance
                        the same, and also such facts, if any, touching the moral, mental, and
                        bodily infirmities or defects of said person, as impair the value of the
                        petitioner's claim to such service or labor, and conclude such statement
                        with an averment that the petitioner knows of no other infirmities or
                        defects of said person which impair the value of petitioner's claim to such
                        service or labor, and that he believes none other to exist. If the
                        petitioner specify no such infirmity or defect, then his statement touching
                        the value of his claim should conclude with an averment that he has no
                        knowledge of any such infirmity or defect.</note>
                    <seg type="handwritten">With the exception of the effects of a burn on her left
                        hand causing the stiffness of one finger I know of no physical defects that
                        detract from <persName>Rachael</persName>'s value as an able bodied
                        servant—Nor do I know of any qualities of mind or body which render
                        her in any way peculiarly valuable, or otherwise.</seg></p>

                <p>Your petitioner hereby declares that <seg type="handwritten">she</seg> bears true
                    and faithful allegiance to the Government of the United States, and that <seg type="handwritten">she</seg> has not borne arms against the United States in
                    the present rebellion, nor in any way given aid or comfort thereto.</p>

                <p>And your petitioner further states and alleges, that <seg type="handwritten">she</seg> has not brought said <seg type="handwritten"><persName>Rachael</persName></seg> into the District of Columbia since
                    the passage of said act of Congress; and that, at the time of the passage
                    thereof, said <seg type="handwritten"><persName>Rachael</persName></seg> was
                    held to service or labor therein under and by virtue of your petitioner's claim
                    to such service or labor.</p>

                <p>Your petitioner further states and alleges, that <seg type="handwritten">her</seg> said claim to the service or labor of said <seg type="handwritten"><persName>Rachael</persName></seg> does not originate in
                    or by virtue of any transfer heretofore made by any person who has in any manner
                    aided or sustained the present rebellion against the Government of the United
                    States.</p>

                <p>And your petitioner prays the said Commissioners to investigate and determine the
                    validity of <seg type="handwritten">her</seg> said claim to the service or labor
                    of said <seg type="handwritten"><persName>Rachael</persName></seg> herein above
                    set forth; and if the same be found to be valid, that they appraise and
                    apportion the value of said claim in money, and report the same to the Secretary
                    of the Treasury of the United States, in conformity to the provisions of said
                    act of Congress.</p>
