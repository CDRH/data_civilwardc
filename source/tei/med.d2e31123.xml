D, 4th New Jersey</name>, aged 30 years, was wounded at <name type="BATTLE" key="58">Petersburg</name>, <date type="injury" when="1865-04-02">April 2, 1865</date>.  On <date type="transfer" when="1865-04-11">the 11th</date>, he was sent to <name type="place" key="#Washington">Washington</name>, to <name type="hospital" key="173">Harewood Hospital</name>. <name type="person" key="158">Surgeon R. B. Bontecou</name>, <name type="organization" key="132">U. S. V.</name>, noted: "Gunshot wound of left shoulder, the ball fracturing the head of the humerus. Resection of the head of the humerus was performed on the field on <date type="operation" when="1865-04-02">April 2d</date>, through a straight incision in the long diameter of the deltoid muscle, about four inches of the shaft being also removed. The case progressed favorably under simple dressings, splints, and supporting treatment, and was doing well up to the end of June, 1865; but no osseous formation had taken place up to that date."  On <date type="transfer" when="1865-07-26">July 26th</date>, he was sent to Ward Hospital, <name type="place">Newark</name>, and thence discharged the service, <date type="servicedischarge" when="1865-08-30">August 30, 1865</date>.  <name type="person" key="xxx">Examiner E. A. Smith</name>, of <name type="place">Philadelphia</name>, <date type="pension" when="1865-09-04">September 4, 1865</date>, reported that: "The wound of operation was then unhealed; there was ligamentous union, and he had all the motions of the forearm and hand."  The pensioner was paid <date type="pension" when="1874-03-04">March 4, 1874</date>.  The wood-cut (<hi rend="initialcap">F</hi>IG. 422) was taken from a photograph in <name type="hospital" key="431">the Museum</name> (<hi rend="italic">Card Photographs</hi>, Vol. II, p. 6).  A letter from this pensioner, dated <date type="pension" when="1874-08-08">August 8, 1874</date>, <name type="place">Berlin, Pennsylvania</name>, states that the operation in this case "was performed by <name type="person" key="xxx">Surgeon R. Sharpe</name>, <name type="organization" key="xxx">15th New Jersey</name>, assisted by <name type="person" key="xxx">Surgeon B. A. Watson</name>, <name type="organization" key="xxx">4th New Jersey</name>.  As to usefulness, it is of very little use. It has gathered and discharged several times.   *   *   I can use the hand some.   *   *   Several pieces of bone have lately come from it. It always has gathered about once a year until last winter, and since then, nearly every month."</p>
