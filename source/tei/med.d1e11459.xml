                                        20</date> he was again taken with fever, pain in the left side and
                                        cough, which became increased during the course of the
                                        following day, when friction sounds were heard over the
                                        heart.  The pain was less severe on the 22d, but the patient
                                        had some headache and œdema of the limbs. He had been
                                        treated with acetate of ammonia and sweet spirit of
                                        nitre; but on this day blue-pill with bicarbonate of soda
                                        was prescribed.  Dyspnœa and cough were troublesome on the
                                        23d, the latter being attended with an expectoration of
                                        glairy mucus. Tartar emetic, brandy and beef-tea were prescribed. The pain was much aggravated on the 25th
                                        and there was <choice><orig>dulness</orig><reg>dullness</reg></choice>

                                        intercostal space; it was opened on <date type="operation" when="1865-03-06">the 8th</date> and discharged
                                two quarts of pus.  The patient died on <date type="death" when="1865-03-12">the 12th</date>.   <hi rend="italic">Post-mortem</hi> examination: The left lung was adherent

                                        was partly collapsed by the pus which had escaped through
                                        the perforation in the chest-wall. Between the fourth and
                                        fifth ribs pus had found its way through the intercostal
                                        muscles but had not reached the skin. The pericardium
                                        contained some purulent liquid, and both pericardium and
                                        heart were covered with tough layers of yellow lymph. [<hi rend="italic">Specimen</hi> No. 521, Med. Sec., <name type="hospital" key="431">Army Medical Museum</name>, shows the
