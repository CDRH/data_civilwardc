                <p rend="bold">To the Commissioners under the act of Congress approved the <date when="1862-04-16">16th of April, 1862</date>, entitled "An Act for the
                    release of certain persons held to service or labor in the <placeName>District
                        of Columbia</placeName>."</p>

                <p>Your Petitioner <persName>Edward Owen</persName> for himself and as <gap reason="illegible" extent="about one word" quantity="6"/> for <unclear reason="illegible" cert="medium" resp="#jc">Dr <persName>J

                    by this his petition in writing represents and states, that he is a person loyal
                    to the <placeName>United States</placeName>, who, at the time of the passage of
                    the said act of Congress, held a claim to service or labor against three persons
                    of African descent of the names following, to wit: <persName>Harriet
                        Hawkins</persName>, and her two children <persName>Virginia
                        Hawkins</persName>, and <persName>Lucinda Hawkins</persName>, for, and
                    during the life of the said <persName>Harriet</persName>,
                        <persName>Virginia</persName>, and <persName>Lucinda</persName>; and that by
                    said act of Congress said <persName>Harriet</persName>,
                        <persName>Virginia</persName> and <persName>Lucinda</persName> were freed
                    and discharged of, and from all claim of your petitioner to such service or
                    labor; that at the time of said discharge, said <persName>Harriet</persName> was
                    of the age of forty years, and no more; the said <persName>Virginia</persName>
                    was of the age of sixteen years and no more; and the said
                        <persName>Lucinda</persName> was of the age of eight years and not more; and
                    all three of them of the personal description following: all of them mulattoes,
                    or brown in color, slightly curled hair with no special distinguishing marks,
                    peculiarities, or appearance different from other persons of similar
                    condition.</p>
                <p>That the <gap reason="illegible" extent="about one word" quantity="10" unit="chars"/> your petitioner acquired his claim to the aforesaid service
                    or labor of said <persName>Harriet</persName>, <persName>Virginia</persName> and
                        <persName>Lucinda</persName> by intermarriage with <persName>Virginia
                        Barrell</persName>, who

                    acquired the same by inheritance from her father, in about the year <date when="1854">1854</date>, then a resident of the <placeName>State of
                        Virginia</placeName>, and your petitioner never had any written evidence of

                        <persName>Lucinda</persName>, was at the time of the said discharge
                    therefrom, of the value of twenty five hundred dollars in money; and that
                    neither of them labor under any more or physical defect impairing their
                    value.</p>

                <p>Your petitioner hereby declares that he bears true &amp; faithful allegiance to
                    the government of the <placeName>United States</placeName>, &amp; that he has
                    not borne arms against the <placeName>United States</placeName> in the present
                    rebellion, nor in any way given aid or comfort thereto.</p>

                <p>And your petitioner further states and alleges, that he has not brought the said
                    persons into the <placeName>District</placeName> since the passage of said Act,
                    and that, at the time of the passage thereof said persons were held to service
                    or labor therein, under &amp; by virtue of your <choice>
                        <sic>petitioners</sic>
                        <corr>petitioner's</corr>
                    </choice> claim to such service or labor.</p>

                <p>Your petitioner further states and alleges, that his said claim to the service or
                    labor of said <persName>Harriet</persName>, <persName>Virginia</persName> and
                        <persName>Lucinda</persName>, does not originate in, or by virtue of any
                    transfer heretofore made by any person who has in any manner aided or sustained
                    the present rebellion against the Government of the <placeName>United
                        States</placeName>.</p>

                <p>And your petitioner prays the said Commissioners to investigate and determine the
                    validity of his said claim to the service or labor of said
