                a skirmish near <name type="place">Culpeper, Virginia</name>, <date type="injury" when="1863-10-11">October 11th, 1863</date>, by a pistol ball which fractured
                the superior portion of the frontal bone a little to the left of the median line. He
                was taken prisoner, conveyed to <name type="place" key="#Washington">Washington</name>, and taken to the <name type="hospital" key="172">Emory
                    Hospital</name> on <date type="operation" when="1863-10-13"><date type="admit" when="1863-10-13">the 13th</date></date>. He was free from pain and
                conscious when admitted, but had some tendency to stupor. Spiculæ of bone were
                removed from the wound, simple dressings applied, and a cathartic administered. On
                the 14th the tendency to coma increased, and a venous hæmorrhage from the wound
                occurred, and cerebral matter exuded. The pulsations of the brain were distinctly
                visible at the opening. At eight o'clock in the evening, these symptoms were still
                graver, and the patient could be aroused only with great difficulty. He gradually
                sank and died on the following morning, <date type="death" when="1863-10-15">October
                    15th, 1863</date>. The autopsy showed that the ball had split upon the skull,
                one portion passing underneath the scalp for a short distance, the other entering
                the brain. The left lobe of the cerebrum was greatly disorganized and broken down.
