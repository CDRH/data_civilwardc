          Clark</name>, <name type="organization" key="xxx">Co. I, 1st United States Cavalry</name>,
        was struck by a carbine ball in the cavalry fight near <name type="BATTLE" key="107">Brandy
          Station, Virginia</name>, <date type="injury" when="1863-08-01">August 1st, 1863</date>.
        On <date type="admit" when="1863-08-02">the next day</date> he was admitted to <name type="hospital" key="162">Douglas Hospital</name>, Washington. <date type="operation" when="1863-08-02">When admitted</date>, the bullet was discovered beneath the integument,
        below the inferior angle of the left scapula, whence it was removed by <name type="person" key="616">Acting Assistant Surgeon J. E. Smith</name>. The wound of entrance was found
        anteriorly over the third rib, which had been fractured. This case was diagnosed as a
        penetrating wound of the left thoracic cavity, involving the upper lobe of the lung. There
        had been hæmoptysis and dyspnœa, and there was when admitted great prostration.
        The clinical history of the case is very imperfect. On <date type="death" when="1863-08-07">the 7th</date>, the patient was found almost <hi rend="italic">in articulo mortis</hi>,
        and fully comprehended the situation; but after a consultation it was concluded that no
        operation at that period would be of avail. The effusion had almost filled the left side,
        and was causing dyspnœa and profound depression, and at 11 A. M. death took place.
        Previous to the autopsy, a <choice>
          <orig>trocar</orig>
          <reg>trochar</reg>
        </choice> was introduced below the angle of the scapula, between the eleventh and twelfth
        ribs, and evacuated half a gallon of bloody serum. On examining the lungs, the track of the
        bullet was found lined with spiculæ of bone from the comminuted rib. There was local
        pneumonia of the upper lobe, with the usual evidence of pleuritis; copious effusion of
        serum, and extensive exudations of lymph. No other lesions were discovered, and death
        occurred from the traumatic pleuritis and its consequent effusion. The accompanying wood cut
          (<hi rend="initialcap">F</hi>IG. 279) gives some idea of the course of the ball. It was
        drawn from a wet preparation forwarded to <name type="hospital" key="431">the Museum</name>
        by <name type="person" key="200">Assistant Surgeon W. Thomson</name>, <name type="organization" key="190">U. S. A.</name>, then in charge of <name type="hospital" key="162">Douglas Hospital</name>. </p>
