                    said; if so, he is now thirty six years old. He is very able-bodied, and
                    remarkably healthy. I do not recollect of his being sick a single day since I
                    owned him. I have permitted him to hire himself out for the last six or seven

                    my consent. I now learn he left Mr. <persName>McCormick</persName> last winter
