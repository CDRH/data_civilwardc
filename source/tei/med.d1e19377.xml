        <hi rend="initialcap">C</hi>ASE.—<name type="person">Private Charles P. Betts</name>,
          <name type="organization">Co. I, 26th New Jersey Volunteers</name>, aged 22 years, was
        struck by a three-ounce grapeshot, on the morning of <date type="injury" when="1863-05-03">May 3d, 1863</date>, in a charge upon the heights of <name type="BATTLE" key="251">Fredericksburg</name>. The ball comminuted the sternum, at the level of the third rib, on
        the left side, and tore through the costal pleura. It remained in the wound and was removed
        by the patient. On <date type="admit" when="1863-05-04">the following day</date>, Betts
        entered the hospital of the 2d division of the Sixth Corps. Through the wound, the arch of
        the aorta was distinctly visible, and its pulsations could be counted. The left lung was
        collapsed. When sitting up there was but slight dyspnœa. Several <date type="operation" when="1863-05-04">fragments of the sternum were removed</date>, and the wound soon
        granulated kindly. On <date type="injury" when="1863-05-10">May 10th</date>, a colored
        drawing of the wound was made.† (No. 19, Surgical Series of Drawings, S. G. O.) On
        July 5th, the patient was transferred to <name type="place" key="#Washington">Washington</name>, convalescent. He ultimately recovered perfectly. This man was
        discharged the service on <date type="servicedischarge" when="1863-06-27">June 27th,
          1863</date>, and was subsequently pensioned, his disability being rated three-fourths and
        permanent. On <date type="pension" when="1864-04-05">April 5th, 1864</date>, <name type="person">Pension Examiner L. A. Smith</name> reports that the injured lung "still
        continues defective somewhat, causing dyspnœa." The following is an extract from
        the patient's letter, dated <name type="place">Newark, New Jersey</name>, <date type="pension" when="1872-04-22">April 22, 1872</date>, in reply to an inquiry regarding
        his condition: "My wound is not what you would call a running sore exactly, but still
        there is all the while a kind of dry scab forming and coming off one after the other, and it
        is very tender. I have spoken to several doctors about it, and they say that it will always
        be so on account of the bone being broken in such a way that it is ragged and does not heal
        solid. My health is as good as I ever expect it to be again. My left lung is a very delicate
        thing, and the least cold seems to go right to it, and the weather we have here at this
        season of the year is very rough on me; but I suppose there is no use of crying over spilt
        milk, but must only try to make the best of a bad job." </p>
      <p> † The drawing was made at the Potomac Creek Hospital of the 2d division, Sixth
        Corps, and so faithfully was the likeness of the patient preserved, as well as the features
        of the wound, that <name type="person">Surgeon S. A. Holman</name>, <name type="organization" key="132">U. S. V.</name>, medical director of the <name type="organization">Sixth Corps</name>, in <date type="injury" when="1865">1865</date>,
        turning over a portfolio at the <name type="organization">Surgeon General's Office</name>,
        and, observing this drawing, exclaimed: "I know that man; that's Betts, 2d division,
        Sixth Corps!" </p>
