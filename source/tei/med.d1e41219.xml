The œsophagus, stomach and small intestine were normal. The colon and cæcum were congested. The rectum was ulcerated in several places. The spleen weighed seven ounces and a half; its substance was firm. The liver weighed seventy-one ounces and a half; in its right lobe was an abscess about the size of a large hen-egg, the rest of the organ appeared to be normal; the gall-bladder contained twenty-two drachms of bile.
