      McAllister</name>, <name type="organization" key="459">Co. C, 72d Pennsylvania</name>, was
     wounded in the right knee, at the <name type="BATTLE" key="12">Wilderness</name>, <date type="injury" when="1864-05-06">May 6, 1864</date>, by a minié ball, which entered four inches
     above the external condyle and lodged on the outside of the patella, without perforating the
     capsular ligament.  <name type="person" key="xxx">Surgeon D. Prince</name>, <name type="organization" key="132">U. S. V.</name>, reports that the following treatment was
     resorted to in the case:  "The bone was cut down upon and the missile pulled out.  No
     inflammation of the joint ensued until the eleventh day after the injury, when the joint
     swelled and became excruciatingly painful, attended with free discharge of synovia from the
     wound in front, on the outer side of the patella.  On <date type="operation" when="1864-05-18">May 18th</date>, this opening was enlarged and a
     counter-opening was made behind the external lateral ligament and tendon of the biceps, the
     patient being under the influence of ether. The limb was subjected to moderate extension for
     the following purposes: 1st, to separate the opposing joint surfaces and obviate the ulceration attending contact and pressure, at the same time lessening the amount of irritation; 2d, to obviate the caries and necrosis of bone apt to follow, and making bony anchylosis
     impossible; 3d, to preserve the limb in a position to be afterwards useful. The patient was
     relieved of suffering by the incision and experienced a feeling of comfort from the moderate
     extension."  The records in this case show that the patient was admitted to the  field hospital of the 2d division, Second Corps, with "shot
     wound of knee," and <name type="person" key="126">Surgeon T. R. Crosby</name>, <name type="organization" key="132">U. S. V.</name>, reported that the man entered <name type="hospital" key="157">Columbian Hospital</name>, Washington, <date type="transfer" when="1864-05-28">May 28th</date>, with "shot wound of right knee joint," of which he died on
     the following day, <date type="death" when="1864-05-29">May 29, 1864</date>. </p>
