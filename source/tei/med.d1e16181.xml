        to the left of the median line. On <date type="admit" when="1865-03-26">the following

        articulate or raise the right hand; his tongue inclined to the right side, when protruded.
        His pulse was slow but strong. Being placed under the influence of chloroform on <date type="operation" when="1865-03-31">March 31st</date>, <name type="person" key="884">Surgeon N. R. Moseley</name>, <name type="organization" key="132">U. S. V.</name>,
        enlarged the wound, removing numerous portions of the cranium, with pieces of the ball. On
        April 2d, pills of calomel and extract of henbane were administered to produce slight
        ptyalism. On <date type="injury" when="1865-04-15">April 15th</date>, the patient was able
        to walk and speak, and had proper use of all parts of the body. On <date type="transfer" when="1865-06-03">June 3d</date>, he was transferred to the <name type="hospital">Mower
          Hospital at Philadelphia</name>; thence, on <date type="transfer" when="1865-07-24">July
