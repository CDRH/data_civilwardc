                                        the viscera appeared to be healthy except the intestines.
                                        The mucous membrane of the ileum was deeply injected
                                        throughout and of a dark purple color; its solitary
                                        follicles were enlarged and some near the
                                        ileo-cæcal valve were ulcerated; Peyer's patches,

                                        appearance. The colon presented a number of deep ulcers,
                                        especially at its extremities; in the transverse colon
                                        several of the ulcers were cicatrizing. An intestinal
