The limb was placed upon a double-inclined plane and the fragments were placed in apposition as nearly as possible. The patient was worn out with exposure and anxiety and had some diarrhœa. Slight hæmorrhages occurred on September 4th and 7th, which readily yielded to pressure.  On <date type="injury" when="1864-09-08">September 8th</date> a severe hæmorrhage took place, exhausting in amount, from which the patient sank rapidly, and died <date type="death" when="1864-09-08">the same day</date>.  The <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> examination showed the heart to be exsanguineous and without clot; pus in body of the sternum; lungs sound; liver pale and anæmic; other organs sound. Evidences of hæmorrhage from branches of the profunda artery were found."</p>
