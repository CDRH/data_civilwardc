          on the 25th, followed by fever and diarrhœa, for which quinine had been given.  On
          the evening of admission he was drowsy, his face slightly flushed, pulse 85 and of good
          strength, skin dry and warm, showing a few rose-colored spots on the abdomen and chest,
          tongue red, smooth, dry and glossy, teeth blackened with sordes, bowels quiet; he had no
          appetite, some abdominal tenderness and gurgling, but no meteorism.  Milk-punch, turpentine
          emulsion and beef-essence were prescribed on November 2.  The skin became covered with
          sudamina on the 4th and the appetite was improved. A full dose of castor oil on this day
          produced one large evacuation.  On the 7th the patient was looking bright and lively, and
          on the following day was up and walking about.  He was transferred to <name type="place">Annapolis Md.</name>, on <date type="transfer" when="1861-11-18">the 18th</date>. </p>
