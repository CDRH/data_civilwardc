     Hospital</name> at Washington, and <date type="transfer" when="1863-06">several days
     afterwards</date> he was transferred to <name type="hospital" key="xx">Satterlee Hospital at
     Philadelphia</name>. <name type="person" key="1498">Acting Assistant Surgeon D. Kennidy</name>
    contributed the specimen (<hi rend="italic">Cat. Surg. Sect.</hi>, 1866, p. 458, <hi rend="italic">Spec</hi>. 2607) with the following minutes of the case: "Patient was wounded by
    a shell in the left arm, rendering amputation near the shoulder necessary. The operation was
    performed upon the battlefield, about <date type="operation" when="1863-05-03">fifteen minutes
     after he received the wound</date>, without the administration of anæsthetics. At the time
    he was transferred to this hospital he had erysipelas of left side of thorax and back. He was
    immediately placed on <hi rend="italic">tinctura ferri chlor. gtts xx</hi> every three hours,
    and <hi rend="italic">unguent. ferri sulph.</hi> used locally. The stump, which suppurated
    freely, was dressed with a poultice. He began to improve, and by June 30th the erysipelas had
    disappeared and he was fast gaining strength. July 5th: Had slight diarrhœa; prescribed
    astringents. July 6th: Not so well; very weak. Ordered beef essence and wine whey. July 8th:
    Bled about a pint from the stump; ice-water and compress applied. <date type="operation" when="1863-07-09">July 9th</date>: Had another hæmorrhage early in the morning; subclavian
    artery ligated at its third part. Present at the operation: <name type="person" key="137">Drs.
     Hayes</name>, <name type="person" key="xx">Schell</name>, <name type="person" key="xx">Baldwin</name>, and <name type="person" key="xx">Roe</name>. Prescribed brandy, one-half ounce
    every two hours. July 10th: Feels stronger and pulse good; ordered sulphate of quinine, <hi rend="italic">grs. ii</hi>, three times a day. He continued to do well until the 16th, when he
    had a hæmorrhage from the artery where it had been ligated; bled about a pint; digital
    pressure applied. July 17th: No bleeding. Early in the morning of the 18th he lost some blood
    while changing the fingers. His pulse had been very weak since the 16th, and he was fast losing
    strength. About 10 o'clock on the morning of <date type="death" when="1863-07-18">the 18th of
     July</date> he died. The specimen consists of a wet preparation of the arch of the aorta, the
    innominata, left common carotid, and subclavian arteries, terminating at the point of
    ineffectual ligation of the left subclavian in its third portion, showing the separation of the
    coats with no formation of clot.</p>
