                    of African descent of the name of <seg type="handwritten"><persName>Henneretta

                        city at the urgent request of said <persName>Henneretta</persName> to keep
                        her from being sold south as per accompanying Bill of Sale.</seg></p>

                <p>That your petitioner's claim to the service or labor of said <seg type="handwritten"><persName>Henneretta</persName></seg> was, at the time of

                        same, and also such facts, if any, touching the moral, mental, and bodily
                        infirmities or defects of said person, as impair the value of the

                        petitioner specify no such infirmity or defect, then his statement touching
                        the value of his claim should conclude with an averment that he has no

                <p>Your petitioner hereby declares that <seg type="handwritten">he</seg> bears true

                    the present rebellion, nor in any way given aid or comfort thereto.</p>

                <p>And your petitioner further states and alleges, that <seg type="handwritten">he</seg> has not brought said <seg type="handwritten"><persName>Henneretta</persName></seg> into the District of Columbia
                    since the passage of said act of Congress; and that, at the time of the passage
                    thereof, said <seg type="handwritten"><persName>Henneretta</persName></seg> was
                    held to service or labor therein under and by virtue of your petitioner's claim
                    to such service or labor.</p>

                <p>Your petitioner further states and alleges, that <seg type="handwritten">his</seg> said claim to the service or labor of said <seg type="handwritten"><persName>Henneretta</persName></seg> does not originate
                    in or by virtue of any transfer heretofore made by any person who has in any
                    manner aided or sustained the present rebellion against the Government of the
                    United States.</p>

                <p>And your petitioner prays the said Commissioners to investigate and determine the

                    above set forth; and if the same be found to be valid, that they appraise and
