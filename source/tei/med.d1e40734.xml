Brain not examined. There was a large cavity in the upper lobe of the right lung, in which a clot showed the point from which the hæmorrhage took place. There was also a very large cavity in the same portion of the left lung. There were slight pleuritic adhesions on the right side, and very extensive ones on the left. The pericardium contained about two ounces of serum. The heart was healthy. The stomach and intestines were nearly normal; the latter showing very little to account for the long-continued chronic diarrhœa from which the patient had suffered.—<name type="person" key="xxx">Acting Assistant Surgeon Joseph D. Osborne</name>.</p>
