                                                  made a semi-lunar incision in the scalp, and
                                                  dissected up the flap, when a copious hæmorrhage
                                                  occurred. He then removed several small detached
                                                  pieces of bone, and also a triangular piece of the
                                                  internal table, which was pressing heavily upon
                                                  the dura mater, and by means of an elevator,
                                                  raised an adjacent portion of the bone. The
                                                  membranes of the brain were found to be
                                                  penetrated, and from the character of the
                                                  discharge, it was believed that the brain itself
                                                  was seriously injured. The pulsations of the
                                                  middle meningeal artery were distinctly felt.  After the operation the symptoms of compression
                                                  passed away. The patient was much prostrated, but
                                                  in the full possession of his senses.  He was kept in bed, on low diet, and under
                                                  antiphlogistic treatment.  On October 23d he was
                                                  attacked with colliquative diarrhœa.  Pyæmia
