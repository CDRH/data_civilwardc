   <p><hi rend="initialcap">C</hi>ASE 193.— "<name type="person" key="939">Captain James
     M. L——</name>, <name type="organization" key="211">Co. I, 20th Indiana</name>, was
    twice wounded in an engagement in front of <name type="place">Richmond</name>, on <date type="injury" when="1862-06-27">June 27, 1862</date>. The first wound was through the lumbar
    muscles, and, while lying on the field, he was again struck by a conoidal musket ball, which
    entered on the outer side of the left thigh a little below the great trochanter, and, passing
    upward and inward, lodged. He was conveyed to <name type="place" key="#Washington">Washington</name>, and on <date type="admit" when="1862-06-29">June 29th</date> was admitted
    to the <name type="hospital" key="157"><choice>
      <orig>Columbia</orig>
      <reg>Columbian</reg>
     </choice> College Hospital</name>. A finger could be readily passed into the perforation of the
    femur, but the ball could not be reached. There was no shortening or eversion of the limb,
    interfering with the motion of the joint. Three formal attempts to ascertain the position of the
    ball and accomplish its removal were unsuccessfully made. The patient died from exhaustion,
     <date type="death" when="1862-08-19">August 19, 1862</date>." The specimen is represented
    in the adjoining wood-cut (<hi rend="initialcap">F</hi>IG. 46). It shows the upper portion of
    the left femur perforated between the trochanters on the posterior surface. The track of the
    ball is carious. The great trochanter has been split off, but is reunited by callus. The space
    between the trochanters is bridged over by a displaced fragment of bone, attached in its new
    position by slight osseous deposits. The missile was found resting against the capsular
    ligament. <name type="person" key="940">Assistant Surgeon W. M. Notson</name>, <name type="organization" key="190">U. S. A.</name>, who attended and reported the case, is confident
    that the ball was external to the joint; but as the grooving of the neck extends upward nearly
    to the articular surface of the femur, it is hardly possible that the joint escaped.—(<hi rend="italic">Circular</hi> 2, p. 75, <hi rend="initialcap">C</hi>ASE 69.) </p>
