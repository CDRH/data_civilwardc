According to the final report of the commissioners, Clement Weeden (petition number 144) was awarded $613.20, $104 of which was to be paid to William Speak (named in the bond below); the remainder went to Weeden. It appears as though this piece of evidence has been grouped and microfilmed with petition number 184; jc, 2013-01-29. -->
