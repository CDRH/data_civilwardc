Chronic diarrhœa.  [This man appears on the register of the hospital of his regiment, near <name type="place">Raleigh, North Carolina</name>, admitted <date type="admit" when="1865-04-16">April 16th</date>—acute diarrhœa—sent to general hospital <date type="transfer" when="1865-04-26">April 26th</date>.]  Was very much emaciated.  Treatment: Astringents, Dover's powder, stimulants and suitable diet. The patient improved at first, but had a relapse June 6th, which resisted treatment. He became dispirited, stupid and lethargic.  Died, <date type="death" when="1865-06-13">June 13th</date>.  <hi rend="italic">Autopsy</hi> <date type="autopsy" when="1865-06-13">six hours after death</date>: The thoracic viscera were normal. The liver was much congested, the bile of a dark-red color. No intestinal ulceration was discovered.</p> 
   <p>⃰ It is to be regretted that, in most instances, the records of this hospital do not show by whom the autopsies were made. It is known that many of them were made by <name type="person" key="134">Surgeon Bentley</name> himself, or under his immediate supervision, but it is only possible to distinguish these from the others in a few cases.</p>
