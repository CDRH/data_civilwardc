    admission to the field hospital of the 1st division, Second Corps, with wound of left ankle by a
    musket ball." <name type="person" key="884">Surgeon N. R.Moseley</name>, <name type="organization" key="132">U. S. V.</name>, who amputated the fractured limb, reported the
    following result of the case: "The wounded man was admitted on <date type="transfer" when="1864-05-28">May 28th</date> to <name type="hospital" key="172">Emory Hospital</name>,
    Washington, where the soft parts became gangrenous and the bones of the ankle joint necrosed;
    tibia and fibula denuded of periosteum some three inches above the wound. Flap amputation of the
    leg at the junction of the upper and middle thirds was performed on <date type="operation" when="1864-08-23">August 23d</date>, chloroform and ether constituting the anæsthetic. The
    after-treatment consisted of cold-water dressings, tonics, stimulants, and nourishing diet.
    Redundant granulations required the application of caustics about three weeks after the
    amputation. The patient's condition varied much after the operation, alternately recuperating
    and declining. He became weaker, yet, being young, hopes were entertained of his recovery until
    within a couple of weeks of his decease, when his appetite failed and he sank rapidly. Death
    occurred on <date type="death" when="1864-10-14">October 14, 1864</date>, from exhaustion and
    nervous irritability." The bones of the stump (<hi rend="italic">Spec</hi>. 3318), exhibiting
    but little healthy action and showing sequestra which are about separating from each bone, were
    contributed to <name type="hospital" key="431">the Museum</name> by <name type="person" key="884">the operator</name>, and are represented in the adjoining wood-cut (<hi rend="initialcap">F</hi>IG. 317). </p>
