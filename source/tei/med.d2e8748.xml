      Ryder</name>, <name type="organization" key="143">Co. B, 121st New York</name>, aged 22 years,
     was wounded <name type="BATTLE" key="58">before Petersburg</name>, <date type="injury" when="1865-04-02">April 2, 1865</date>, and admitted to the field hospital of the 1st division, Sixth Corps, where <name type="person" key="xx">Surgeon R. Sharpe</name>, <name type="organization" key="402">15th New Jersey</name>, noted:
     "Shot fracture of left thigh; splints applied." On <date type="transfer" when="1865-04-03">the day following the injury</date> the wounded man
     was sent to the Depot Hospital at <name type="place">City Point</name>, and, on
      <date type="transfer" when="1865-04-12">April 12th</date>, he was transferred to <name type="hospital" key="171">Armory Square Hospital</name>, Washington, whence <name type="person" key="424">Acting Assistant Surgeon G. K. Smith</name> reported the following history:
     "The wound was caused by a conoidal ball, which struck the femur about six inches above the
     patella, fracturing the shaft of the bone and lodging. But slight constitutional disturbance
     took place, and the quantity of discharge from the wound sac very moderate. The position of the
     ball could not be ascertained. The patient was treated on <name type="person" key="xxx">Dr. Gurdon Buck</name>'s plan. Two weeks
     after his admission, the injured limb was found to be shortened one and one-quarter inches. By
     June 9th the wound had healed, but bony union was still incomplete and extension by weights was
     continued. On July 8th the femur was found to be firmly consolidated, and the patient was
     allowed to go about on crutches. He was mustered out of service <date type="servicedischarge" when="1865-08-02">August 2, 1865</date>, his general health being good and his injured leg
     shortened less than an inch." <name type="person" key="xx">Examiner J. C. Tibbets</name>, of
     <name type="place" key="xx">Warsaw, New York</name>, certified, <date type="pension" when="1872-10-14">October 14, 1872</date>: "The
     ball passed through the rectus muscle, fractured the bone, and lodged in the posterior pan of
     the thigh among the muscles, where it still remains. The muscles in the back of the leg and thigh are contracted, so that walking
     or even much resting on the limb causes spasms (cramps), etc." The pensioner was paid <date type="pension" when="1879-03-04">March 4,
