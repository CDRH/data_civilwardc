Chronic diarrhœa.  This case was complicated with hemorrhoids and great irritability of the stomach. An unusual degree of jactitation was noticed during the last week of his life.  Died comatose, <date type="death" when="1864-10-20">October 20th</date>.  <hi rend="italic">Autopsy</hi> <date type="autopsy" when="1864-10-20">eight hours after death</date>: There was an excess of black pigment on the surfaces of the lungs, which were otherwise healthy; the lower lobe of the right lung was adherent to the thoracic parietes. The mucous membrane of the small intestine was inflamed throughout its whole length. The colon was extensively ulcerated. The liver was unusually large, and presented the nutmeg appearance. The kidneys were fatty.</p> 
   <p>⃰ It is to be regretted that, in most instances, the records of this hospital do not show by whom the autopsies were made. It is known that many of them were made by <name type="person" key="134">Surgeon Bentley</name> himself, or under his immediate supervision, but it is only possible to distinguish these from the others in a few cases.</p>
