B. Bontecou</name>, <name type="organization" key="132">U. S.

Operation performed on the field, <date type="operation" when="1864-06-03">June 3d</date>.  On admission the constitutional state of the patient and condition of the injured parts were good; parts healing readily under treatment of simple dressing and a supportive nourishing diet, but with no restoration of bony structures; the muscles of the forearm and arm remain well developed and useful."  <name type="person" key="xxx">Newell</name> was discharged from service <date type="servicedischarge" when="1864-10-03">October 3, 1864</date>, and pensioned.  <name type="person" key="xxx">Examiner John Spencer</name>, <date type="pension" when="1866-10-15">October 15, 1866</date>, reported: "The whole upper half of the humerus, from the middle of the humerus to the humero-scapular junction, resected. The arm is useless above the hand and forearm; disability is permanent, and I cannot conscientiously rate it less than equal to loss of the hand."  <name type="person" key="xxx">Examiner H. B. Osborn</name>, on <date type="pension" when="1873-09-08">September 8, 1873</date>, reported substantially as above, adding that the arm was still useless. <name type="person" key="xxx">This pensioner</name> was paid <date type="pension" when="1874-03-04">March 4, 1874</date>. The photograph from which the cut (<hi rend="initialcap">F</hi>IG. 435) is taken was sent from <name type="hospital" key="173">Harewood Hospital</name>, and is shown at page 8, Vol. II, <hi rend="italic">Card Photographs</hi>.  In a letter dated <name type="place">Sherman, New York</name>, <date type="pension" when="1874-07-28">July 28, 1874</date>, <name type="person" key="xxx">the pensioner</name> remarks:  "My arm is as useful to me as it ever will be; it often gathers and breaks, or rather it has to be lanced.   *   *   I have the use of my hand, but cannot put it to my mouth only as I take the other hand. I can place it on the table and hold my fork, but cannot feed myself with it.   *   *   My arm is of but little account, yet I would not have it off for anything."</p>
