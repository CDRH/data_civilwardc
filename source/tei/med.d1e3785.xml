                                        with ague which lasted for six weeks, after which he was
                                        confined to bed with abdominal pains. He was admitted <date type="admit" when="1861-09-29">September 29</date>
                                        as a case of typhoid fever. For some days after admission he
                                        rested well at night, but had from two to six stools daily
                                        with, but sometimes without, tympanites and abdominal
                                        tenderness, chiefly marked in the umbilical and left iliac
                                        regions; he had some congestion of the face and headache,
                                        and the pulse ranged from 85 to 100, being usually somewhat
                                        more rapid at the evening visit; his skin, which was natural
                                        or slightly moist with the lower pulse and usually hot and
                                        dry with the higher, presented a few rose-spots and a
                                        profuse eruption; he was troubled with anorexia and great
                                        irritability of the stomach; his tongue was moist and white
                                        or yellow-coated, or dry and brown; he had some difficulty
                                        in micturition and afterwards retention of urine. He was
                                        treated with turpentine emulsion, Dover's powder,
                                        astringents and small doses of calomel and opium. On October
                                        5 he was restless at night; his face was congested, eyes
                                        dull, pulse 95 and weak, but his skin was cool and covered
                                        with perspiration. Next night he slept well and in the
                                        morning looked better; pulse 80, regular; skin natural;
                                        tongue moist, clean; appetite good; but the stomach
                                        continued irritable and much green matter was vomited; four
                                        stools were passed. Tincture of iron and astringents were
                                        given. From this time forward the record shows the presence
                                        of occasional headache with dizziness and tinnitus aurium.
                                        The stomach continued irritable, but after the occurrence of
                                        epistaxis on the 10th and free perspiration on the 11th,
                                        this symptom became less prominent and disappeared. The
                                        epistaxis recurred on the 13th, 15h, 17th and 21st. The
                                        tongue was always moist and generally clean, but flabby and
                                        with prominent papillæ. The bowels were loose,
                                        giving two or three passages daily, with decreasing
                                        tympanites, gurgling and general abdominal tenderness,
                                        sometimes particularly marked in the umbilical and right
                                        iliac regions; towards the end of the month the stools
                                        became reduced to one daily. On the 25th quinine in
                                        two-grain doses was given three times daily. The patient was
                                        transferred to <name type="place">Annapolis, Md.</name>, <date type="transfer" when="1861-11-01">November 1</date> [as affected
