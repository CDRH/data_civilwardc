                                        larynx and trachea contained a considerable quantity of
                                        purulent liquid. The right lung, forty-eight ounces and a
                                        half, was studded with tubercle and had a large cavity in
                                        the anterior part of its lower lobe, communicating by an
                                        opening with the cavity of the pleura, which contained
                                        fourteen ounces of a purulent liquid slightly mixed with
                                        blood. The left lung, thirty-eight ounces and a half, had a
                                        large cavity in its apex; its lower lobe was studded with
                                        miliary tubercle. Both ventricles of the heart and the right
                                        auricle contained large, firm, fibrinous clots; the left
                                        auricle contained a small quantity of very black fluid
                                        blood. The spleen was somewhat softened and weighed twelve
                                        ounces. The liver, kidneys and mesenteric glands were normal in appearance.—<hi rend="italic"><name type="person" key="246">Act. Ass't Surgeon H. M.
