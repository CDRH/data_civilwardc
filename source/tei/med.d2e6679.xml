    <hi rend="initialcap">C</hi>ASE 322.—<name type="person" key="973">Private Daniel H.
     Bowman</name>, <name type="organization" key="141">Co. C, 110th Pennsylvania</name>, aged 24
    years, was wounded on <date type="injury" when="1864-07-27">July 27, 1864</date>, at <name type="BATTLE" key="30">Deep Bottom</name>, on the left bank of <name type="place">James
     River</name>. A conoidal musket bull entered at the upper posterior part of the right thigh,
    comminuted the femur from the trochanters downward for several inches and lodged. The wounded
    man was transported to <name type="place" key="#Washington">Washington</name> on a hospital
    steamer, and was received at <name type="hospital" key="176">Lincoln Hospital</name> on <date type="admit" when="1864-07-30">July 30th</date>. The injured limb was shortened two and a half
    inches; the soft parts were badly lacerated. On August 7th the position of the ball at the
    anterior part of the thigh was detected. An incision was made and the ball and several detached
    fragments of bone were removed. On August 17th the wound looked badly, and there was slight
    sloughing. For the next few weeks the patient lost ground steadily. There was profuse
    suppuration, with great constitutional irritation. There appeared to be no attempt at union at
    the seat of the fracture. The patient had become much emaciated, and his powers of resistance
    were failing daily. After due consultation it was determined to amputate at the hip joint. On
     <date type="operation" when="1864-09-15">September 15th</date> the operation was performed by
     <name type="person" key="243">Assistant Surgeon J. C. McKee</name>, <name type="organization" key="190">U. S. A.</name> The patient was rendered insensible by sulphuric ether. The method by
    antero-posterior flaps formed by transfixion was adopted. The amputation was rapidly completed
    and very little blood was lost. The patient did not rally, but died one hour after the
    operation, <date type="death" when="1864-09-15">September 15, 1864</date>. At the autopsy, the
    lungs were found to be attached to the thoracic walls by firm fibrinous adhesions. In the upper
    lobe of the right lung there were two small isolated abscesses. Otherwise the lungs were normal.
    The right weighed 13 and the left 11 ounces. The abdominal viscera were normal, save that the
    liver and kidneys were unusually small, the former weighing 44½ and the latter 9½
    ounces. At the seat of the fracture of the femur (<hi rend="initialcap">F</hi>IG. 101) there was
    no attempt at repair; the fragments were carious: a large one, consisting of nearly half of the
    cylinder of the shaft, was four inches long and was quite detached. Fissures penetrated the
    trochanters and extended posteriorly half-way up the neck of the bone. </p>
