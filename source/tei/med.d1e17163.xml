                                                  inch in diameter. On the afternoon of the 16th,
                                                  Coulton recovered from his stupor and conversed
                                                  rationally, though with difficult articulation. On

                                                  which he perspired freely. On the 20th and on the
                                                  22d, he was again rational for a few hours. Two

                                                  was a portion of the internal table. On the 24th,
                                                  his breathing was stertorous all day, but at night
                                                  a marked improvement in his condition took place;
                                                  the slough had fallen from one of his toes,

                                                  began to regain power over the paralyzed leg, void
                                                  the excrements at will, and could talk without
                                                  difficulty. On the 30th and 31st, he suffered from
                                                  convulsive attacks of nervous delirium. One-fourth
                                                  of a grain of morphia was administered every half
                                                  hour. By August 5th, the paralysis of the left
                                                  side had so far ceased that he could flex his
                                                  extremities and extend his leg, though not with precision.
                                                  From this date, nothing unfavorable occurred until
                                                  September 7th, when he again experienced attacks
                                                  of delirium. On the 27th, after a slight chill, he
                                                  fell into a state of insensibility. A tumor, which
                                                  had formed at the wound beneath the scalp, was
                                                  opened, and upon its discharging about an ounce of
                                                  blood, sensibility was at once restored. Again a
                                                  state of unconsciousness ensued on the 30th, and
                                                  though in a measure relieved by the administration
                                                  of purgatives, it was evident that dissolution was
                                                  near. Death occurred on <date type="death" when="1863-10-02">October 2d</date>. At the
                                                  autopsy, a circular opening one inch in diameter
                                                  was found, just above the right parietal eminence,
                                                  with the edges rounded off and beveled at the
                                                  expense of the inner table. There was also an
                                                  opening in the dura mater, through which a hernia
                                                  cerebri appeared. Upon removing the skull cap,
                                                  three small fragments of the inner table,
                                                  depressed one-fourth of an inch at their free
                                                  edge, were observed attached and agglutinated by
                                                  new ossific deposit, traces of which could also be
                                                  seen in the immediate vicinity. A cerebral abscess
                                                  was found extending from the hernia cerebri to the
                                                  right lateral ventricle containing about two
                                                  ounces of very offensive lead-colored pus. The
                                                  pathological specimens are Nos. 1724 and 1725,
