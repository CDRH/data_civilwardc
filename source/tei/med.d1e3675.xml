                                        appeared on the chest and abdomen, and there was much
                                        tenderness in the umbilical and left iliac regions with a
                                        burning feeling in the epigastric region. Blue-pill with
                                        opium, followed by castor oil, was prescribed. The skin on
                                        the 9th was covered with perspiration; the bowels were moved
                                        twice. On the 10th there were some rose-spots, a burning
                                        feeling in the stomach, tenderness in the umbilical and left
                                        iliac regions, but no passage from the bowels; the tongue
                                        was very red at the tip and edges. Eight grains of quinine
                                        were given with turpentine and tincture of iron. This
