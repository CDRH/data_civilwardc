     margin.  July 1st, suffers much pain in the hand and region of the wound.  July 4th, arm easy;
     hand very painful. The daily use of hypodermic injections of morphia, etc., relieved the pain a
     little.  August 28th, swelling in region of wound, extending over pectoral and axillary regions,
     to vertebral border of scapula, left side, continuing to increase from day to day. Upon
     consultation it was determined to be an <choice><orig>aneurismal</orig><reg>aneurysmal</reg></choice> tumor, and pressure by spiral bandage
     advised, which was continued until <date type="operation" when="1864-09-01">September 1st</date>, when the tumor increased very rapidly. The
     patient was quite irritable and weak. Chloroform was administered and ligation of the
     subclavian artery was performed. On opening the sac the tissues were found so diffused with
     blood and disorganized that amputation at the shoulder joint was advised and performed. Two
     ligatures were placed on the external jugular vein and three at the shoulder. About eighty
     ounces of blood, mostly coagulated, were removed from the aneurism. After the operation the
     patient rallied considerably. He died <date type="death" when="1864-09-02">September 2,
      1864</date>, at 10 o'clock A. M., from exhaustion."  The operator, <name type="person" key="243">Dr. McKee</name>, contributed to the <name type="hospital" key="431">Army Medical
