                                        The left pleural sac contained a few ounces of bloody serum,
                                        the membrane being firm, opaque and thickened by deposits
                                        of lymph; the right cavity was obliterated by firm fibrinous
                                        adhesions; both lungs were studded with tubercles. The
                                        opposed surfaces of the pericardium were so firmly adherent
                                        that it was almost impossible to separate them;
                                        the external surface of the heart was studded with minute
                                        granulations resembling tubercle, which did not penetrate
                                        the cardiac substance, but appeared to be in or
                                        immediately beneath the pericardium. The spleen, ten
                                        ounces, contained minute yellowish-white tubercle-like
                                        bodies. The liver, forty-eight ounces, was very light in
                                        color; the kidneys appeared to be normal. The mucous
                                        membrane of the intestines was much congested.—<hi rend="italic"><name type="person" key="246">Act. Ass't Surgeon H. M. Dean</name>, <name type="hospital" key="176">Lincoln Hospital</name>, Washington, D. C.</hi> </p>
