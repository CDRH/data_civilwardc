                <p>A few weeks <unclear reason="illegible" cert="low" resp="#nnk">ago</unclear> I received a letter from <persName>James
                        McDaniel</persName> asking that I should write to thee and say something
                    about him—how long he lived with us how he conducted himself—what he
                    was engaged at &amp;c &amp;c. and requested that I should write immediately—I have been
                    much engaged since its receipt—but would now say that whilst I lived at
                    the Woollen Factory in <placeName>Goose Creek Neighborhood</placeName>, <persName>James McDaniel</persName> lived with us
                    for probably near two years, a great part of the time boarded with me—and
                    worked in the Factory mostly at the Fulling Dyeing and Finishing department. I
                    found him steady and industrious—attentive to business—entirely
                    clean of the use of Liquor and circumspect in his language and upon the whole
                    regarded him as trusty. I do not know his object in writing to me but feel easy
                    to say this much in his <choice><orig>favour</orig><reg>favor</reg></choice>.</p>
