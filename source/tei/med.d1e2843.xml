                                        admission his pulse was 94; tongue smooth and dry in the
                                        middle, moist at the edges; skin hot and moist; cheeks
                                        flushed; eyes dusky; bowels loose and tender; he had
                                        headache and was dull mentally. Catechu was used. Next day
                                        the characteristic rose-colored spots appeared on the chest
                                        and abdomen and sibilant and sonorous râles were heard over
                                        the chest, especially on the left side. Whiskey-punch and
                                        turpentine emulsion were prescribed. On the 18th the patient
                                        was drowsy and had acute tenderness in the abdomen and
                                        tympanites, although the bowels were quiet. An enema of
                                        soap-suds was administered. On the 19th the skin was moist
                                        and the mind less obtuse, the bowels loose, the tympanites
                                        reduced, but the tenderness was not lessened. The
                                        respirations were increased to 30 on the 20th; bronchitic
                                        sounds were heard over the whole of the chest, and a part of
                                        the lower lobe of the right lung was consolidated. Dover's
                                        powder was given. On the 21st the pulse was 108, soft and
                                        weak, skin hot and dry, showing a few fresh rose-colored
                                        spots; decubitus dorsal with flexed limbs; tongue smooth,
                                        glossy, dry; bowels relaxed, tender and tympanitic in the
                                        iliac regions; the patient was somewhat deaf, and complained
                                        of pains in the limbs. Vibices appeared on the skin on the
                                        25th and 29th, sudamina on the 27th. The tongue became clean
                                        on the 26th and the appetite returned on the 30th, the chest
                                        symptoms meanwhile gradually becoming relieved; the pulse,
                                        however, continued accelerated, 100 to 112. On October 7 a
                                        discharge from the ear was treated with a solution of
                                        nitrate of silver; but it became more profuse and persisted
                                        up to the close of the detailed record. On the 9th the
                                        patient suffered much from pain in the legs, which were
                                        greatly emaciated; sponging with alcohol gave temporary
                                        relief; this pain also continued to the close of the record
                                        on October 17. After this date the only entry made was the
                                        announcement of death from typhoid fever on <date type="death" when="1861-12-31">December 31</date>.
