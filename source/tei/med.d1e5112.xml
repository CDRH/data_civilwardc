                                        This man became affected with intermittent fever in
                                        November, 1861, and continued in ill health from that time.
                                        From the daily entries on the hospital record which cover
                                        the period to March 29, it is found that the case was
                                        regarded as one of typhoid fever, and that the patient was
                                        unable to walk, having a bed-sore on each hip and much
                                        swelling, tenderness and pain in his feet, but his tongue
                                        was moist and clean, appetite good, bowels regular, skin
                                        natural and pulse of fair strength. Stimulants and citrate
                                        of iron and quinine were given, but for some time there was
                                        no improvement in the condition of the feet. Severe frontal
                                        headache was noted as having been present on the 10th and
                                        11th and as having recurred on the 15th, 20th and 29th.
                                        Quinine was prescribed on the 15th. At the time the last
                                        entry was made the bed-sores were healing and the swelling
                                        of the feet had subsided. The patient was discharged from
                                        service <date type="servicedischarge" when="1862-05-03">May
