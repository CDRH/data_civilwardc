                                                  the right side of the chest. The cavity of the
                                                  left pleura was laid open to the extent of two
                                                  inches, and the corresponding lung wounded by a

                                                  admission, patient manifested symptoms of
                                                  pleuropneumonia, accompanied with low muttering
                                                  delirium with a tendency to sleep, with somewhat
                                                  lucid intervals. There was involuntary discharge
                                                  of urine ever after admission, as also of feces,
                                                  with some two or three exceptions. Pulse not more
                                                  frequent than in health, full, yet more hard; skin
                                                  harsh and dry, yet not much above the natural
                                                  temperature; respiration oppressed, but not
                                                  labored. The cavity of left pleura was filled with
                                                  a dark-brown fluid, which was occasionally removed
                                                  by gently placing the patient in a prone position,
                                                  allowing the fluid to escape through the orifice
                                                  of the wound, but for four or five days prior to
                                                  death it was partially removed by the use of a
                                                  syringe. In the latter stage of the disease, fully
                                                  four ounces of serum were effused into the cavity
                                                  daily. These symptoms continued with little
                                                  variation until <date type="operation" when="1864-07-13">July 13th</date>, when profuse

                                                  mammary, which was ligated by <name type="person" key="102">Surgeon O. A. Judson</name>, <name type="organization" key="132">U. S. V.</name>; there was not less than twelve
                                                  ounces of blood lost, and the patient sank more
                                                  rapidly, and died on <date type="death" when="1864-07-19">July 19th, 1864</date>.  Autopsy
                                                  showed the following: Condition of right lung,
                                                  normal; left lung <hi rend="italic">in situ</hi>, firmly bound down to
                                                  wall of chest by recent adhesion; a lacerated
                                                  wound of upper surface of upper lobe about two
                                                  inches in extent, which was gangrenous; lower
                                                  anterior portion of upper lobe gangrenous; this
                                                  lobe was congested elsewhere, except at apex;
                                                  lower lobe in a state of red hepatization; liver
                                                  enlarged, pale, and of a nutmeg appearance; spleen
                                                  enlarged, did not present its usual granular
                                                  appearance. During life, the pulsations of the
                                                  aorta and heart were exposed whenever the effused
                                                  fluid was removed. The treatment of the case
                                                  consisted, in the earlier stages, of moderate
                                                  doses of quinine, with punch, castor oil, and
                                                  cough mixture; in latter stages, diffusible
                                                  stimulants and nourishing diet. <hi rend="italic">Specimen</hi> No. 2925,

                                                  seventh cervical and first three dorsal vertebrae,
                                                  with the corresponding ribs and part of the
                                                  sternum. The second left rib was struck at its
                                                  costal extremity by a bullet, which, passing
                                                  transversely, tore away the cartilage, comminuted
                                                  the sternum, and separated the cartilaginous
                                                  attachment of the second right rib; the sternum is
                                                  extensively necrosed, especially on its internal
                                                  surface, the second portion of which shows traces
                                                  of periosteal disturbance. The specimen and
                                                  history were contributed by the operator. </p>
