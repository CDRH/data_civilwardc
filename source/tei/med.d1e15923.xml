                                                  the pupils were dilated, and the left arm was
                                                  partially paralyzed, but the patient was perfectly
                                                  rational.  On <date type="operation" when="1862-09-14">the 14th</date>, a piece of bone, one and
                                                  one-fourth by three-fourths of an inch, was

                                                  cerate dressings were substituted. Mineral tonics,

                                                  amount of pus, and the patient was able, with some
                                                  effort, to close his hand, but had no further use
