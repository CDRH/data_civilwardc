                                        Diagnosis—pneumonia. This man had measles with
                                        severe sore throat in <date type="injury" when="1861-09">September, 1861</date>. On the 4th he had
                                        headache and deafness; his cheeks were flushed and hot;
                                        pulse weak and rapid; skin hot and moist, showing on the
                                        abdomen some eruption, which disappeared on pressure; tongue
                                        dry and coated; two watery stools were passed; cough was
                                        troublesome, the respiration natural. Next day there was
                                        profuse perspiration and great thirst, the tongue remaining
                                        dry and coated; the bowels were constipated and the patient
                                        suffered from tormina and frequent nausea, tinnitus aurium
                                        and dizziness; the breathing became rapid and the cough
                                        aggravated. Ten grains of calomel were given with three of
                                        jalap. On the following day there was much tendency to
                                        stupor; four watery stools were passed during the night,
                                        after which the bowels became quiet. Little change occurred
                                        during the next two or three days. On the 10th profuse
                                        perspiration occurred; the expectorated matters were
                                        exceedingly viscid. Milk-punch, cod-liver oil and carbonate
                                        of ammonia were given. On the 11th the skin was natural, the
                                        pulse rapid and weak, the tongue moist, clean and tremulous,
                                        but the appetite remained poor; three watery stools were
                                        passed and the cough continued. During the next two days the
                                        quantity of the sputa diminished. On the 13th there was
                                        occasional nausea, and on the 14th the deafness was
                                        increased, although otherwise the patient seemed better, as
                                        the bowels were regular, the skin natural, the cough
                                        lessened and the sputa less viscid and more frothy. The
                                        deafness increased until the 19th, after which it lessened;
                                        the cough prevented sleep at night and the appetite did not return; the tongue was clean
                                        but unnaturally red in color. On the 25th, the last day on
                                        which the symptoms were entered, the appetite was improving.
                                        The patient was furloughed on <date type="furlough" when="1862-04-08">April 8</date>. </p>
