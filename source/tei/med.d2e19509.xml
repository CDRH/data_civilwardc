      <name type="person" key="158">Surgeon R. B. Bontecou</name>, <name type="organization" key="132">U. S. V.</name>, reported: "The patient

     the operation being performed by the circular method at the lower thirds. He stated that he was
     in good health at the time of the operation. At the time of his admission he was suffering from
     diarrhœa, and there were symptoms of gangrene in the stump of the right leg, the tibia and
     fibula protruding; granulations of stump of left leg not very good. The treatment was
     supporting, and included opiates, astringents, and the external application of solution of
     chloride of lime to the gangrenous stump. By June 26th the patient was improving and the
     granulations had become healthy. He was subsequently transferred to the General Hospital at <name type="place">Rochester</name>, discharged <date type="servicedischarge" when="1865-05-31">May 31, 1865</date>, and pensioned, having been previously furnished with
     artificial legs of the "Bly" pattern. In his application for artificial limbs, dated 1870, the
     pensioner described the stumps as being in a "sound condition."  He died <date type="death" when="1874-09-25">September 25, 1874</date>. Though the immediate cause of his death was not
     ascertained, the pensioner's health had been reported as having become very much impaired. </p>
