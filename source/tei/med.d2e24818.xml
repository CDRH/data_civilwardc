    <p><hi rend="initialcap">C</hi>ASE 961.—<hi rend="italic">Fracture of the lower jaw from
      the kick of a horse.</hi>—<name type="person" key="xxx">Assistant Surgeon S. C.
      Sanger</name>, <name type="organization" key="432">6th New York Cavalry</name>, reported the
     following history of the case of "a contused and lacerated wound in connection with fracture,
     which was incurred accidentally. The patient was kicked by a horse. The 'heel cork' or iron
     projection of the shoe impinged the anterior aspect of the lower jaw a little to the right of
     the symphysis, and drove inward a large portion of the alveolar process to which six teeth were
     attached. It was determined to place the fragment <hi rend="italic">in situ</hi>. This was
     difficult because the fracture was impacted at the point where the blow was received and the
     separated bone was drawn inward by the upper fibres of the genio-hyo-glossus muscles. But the
     object was finally accomplished by extracting a tooth from the sound portion of the jaw, when
     the fragment was secured in its place by silk cord and silver wire, two small braces made of
     cork being placed between the movable teeth and the corresponding ones of the upper jaw. The patient was sent to General
      Hospital. The accident happened <date type="injury" when="1863-06-19">June 19, 1863</date>, and on <date type="duty" when="1863-08-18">August 18th</date> the patient arrived back in camp and reported for duty. An
     examination made showed that the bone had united perfectly and without any perceptible
     deformity, but little trace of the severe laceration of the soft parts being discerned in the
     well-shaped and scarcely apparent cicatrix."  This case has been identified as that of <name type="person" key="1422">Farrier J. O. Bivins</name>, <name type="organization" key="432">Co.
       B, 6th New York Cavalry</name>, aged 32 years, who entered <name type="hospital" key="172">Emory Hospital</name>, Washington, <date type="admit" when="1863-06-22">three days after the date of the injury</date>, and was returned
     to duty <date type="duty" when="1863-08-13">August 13, 1863</date>. He was mustered out of
     service <date type="servicedischarge" when="1864-09-19">September 19, 1864</date>, and has since then
     filed an application for pension.</p>
