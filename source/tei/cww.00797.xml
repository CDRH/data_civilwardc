                <p>That your petitioner acquired his claim to the aforesaid service or labor of
                    persons as before named and described in manner following: by purchase as
                    follows: <persName>Peter Warring</persName> from Mr. <persName>West</persName>
                    about year <date when="1855">1855</date>: <persName>Nathan Brooks</persName>
                    from <persName>Peter G. Posey</persName> about <date when="1849">1849</date> and
                        <persName>Rebecca Brisco</persName> together with <persName>Mary</persName>,
                    then about one year old, about the year <date when="1847">1847</date>, of
                        <persName>Mrs. Clement Smith</persName> of <placeName>Georgetown
                        D.C.</placeName>: the said <persName>Henry</persName>,
                        <persName>Joseph</persName>, <persName>Washington</persName>
                    <persName>Martha</persName>, and <persName>Fanny Brisco</persName>, have been
                    born from the said <persName>Rebecca</persName> since my purchase of her as
                    aforesaid and while in my service: the bills of sale in the instances mentioned
                    are now in petitioner's possession and will be produced: <pb xml:id="leaf001v" facs="cww.00797.002.jpg"/> that your petitioner's claim to the service or
                    labor of said persons as before named and described was at the time of said
                    discharge therefrom of the value of five thousand, nine hundred dollars in
                    money, all and every of said persons being as your petitioner avers, free from
                    all mental, moral or physical defect—so far as his knowledge extends, and
                    two of them were competent butchers: the value in money is estimated as follows:
                    viz: for <persName>Peter Warring</persName> $800.—for <persName>Nathan
                        Brooks</persName> $800. for <persName>Rebecca Brisco</persName> $600: for
                        <persName>Mary</persName> $1000. for <persName>Henry</persName> $800: for
                        <persName>Joseph</persName> $700. for <persName>Washington</persName> $500:
                    for <persName>Martha</persName> $400: for <persName>Fanny</persName> $300: total
                    $5900: this valuation however your petitioner begs leave to state is what he
                    estimates as the cash valuation at the time said act of Congress was approved
                    and is nothing like the <hi rend="underline">real</hi> valuation: inasmuch as he
                    was offered more than that for some of them, but that he never sold a slave, and
                    never would sell one—and never intended selling any of them.</p>

                <p>Your petitioner hereby declares that he bears true &amp; faithful allegiance to
                    the <placeName>United States</placeName> Government and that he has not borne
                    arms against the <placeName>United States</placeName> in the present rebellion
                    nor in any way given aid or comfort thereto: and further that he has not brought
                    said persons before named and described, or either of them into the
                        <placeName>District of Columbia</placeName> since the passage of said Act of
                    Congress, but that at the time of the passage thereof said persons and all of
                    them were held to service or labor therein under your petitioner's claim to such
                    service or labor.</p>

                <p>Your petitioner further states and alleges that his said claim to the service or
                    labor of said described persons does not originate in or by virtue of any
                    transfer heretofore made by any person who has in any manner aided or sustained
                    the present rebellion against the Government of the <placeName>United
                        States</placeName>: and he prays the said Commissioners to investigate and
                    determine the validity of his said claim to the service or labor of said before
                    named and described persons of African descent herein above set forth: and if
                    the same be found valid, that they appraise and apportion the value of said
                    claim in money and report the same to the Secretary of the Treasury of the
                        <placeName>United States</placeName> in conformity to the provisions of said
                    Act of Congress.</p>
