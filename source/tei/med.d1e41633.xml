Acute diarrhœa.  Died, <date type="death" when="1864-09-02">September 2d</date>.  <hi rend="italic">Autopsy</hi> <date type="autopsy" when="1864-09-02">two hours and a half after death</date>: No rigor mortis; no stasis; body much emaciated. There was some effusion of serum beneath the arachnoid; the brain-substance was normal, or a trifle harder than usual; the lateral ventricles contained three or four drachms of serum; the middle commissure of the brain was absent. There was an abscess in the left parotid gland. The lungs were of a gray color mottled with black, and were adherent on both sides by firm bands to the thoracic parietes and the diaphragm. The heart was normal; its right ventricle contained a mixed clot, both auricles yellow clots. The liver was small, pale, and rather free from blood. The spleen two inches and a half long by an inch and a half wide. The kidneys were normal. The transverse colon, descending colon and rectum were of a dark-red color, and presented numerous ulcers. The ileum was not inflamed. The mesenteric glands not enlarged.</p> 
   <p>⃰ It is to be regretted that, in most instances, the records of this hospital do not show by whom the autopsies were made. It is known that many of them were made by <name type="person" key="134">Surgeon Bentley</name> himself, or under his immediate supervision, but it is only possible to distinguish these from the others in a few cases.</p>
