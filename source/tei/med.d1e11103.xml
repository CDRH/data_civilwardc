                gunshot missile, probably a musket ball, which caused only very little external
                injury. He was admitted to the Baptist Church, 3d division, Sixth Corps Hospital, at

                being somewhat coated. The intellect was unimpaired. He seemed to improve and was
                soon able to leave the ward. He continued so for two or three days when he again
                took to his bed, complaining of slight pain in the head, but manifesting no
                aberration of mind. Coma and subsultus tendinum supervened; discharge of blood and
                pus from the right, and pus only from the left, ear occurred, and death ensued on
