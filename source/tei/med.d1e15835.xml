                                                  the mastoid portion of the left temporal bone
                                                  about one and a half inches above and behind the
                                                  meatus auditorius externus, and lodged.  After
                                                  remaining insensible for a few minutes, he
                                                  attempted to rise, but being unable to control his
                                                  limbs, he would constantly stumble and fall. He
                                                  states that he introduced his little finger into
                                                  the wound for more than an inch, and could feel
                                                  the brain substance. Spiculæ of bone were
                                                  removed.  On <date type="admit" when="1862-09-15">September 15th</date>, he was sent to the
                                                                hospital at <name type="place">Frederick</name>, and thence was transferred,
                                                                on <date type="transfer" when="1862-09-19">September 19th</date>, to the <name type="hospital" key="159">Patent Office Hospital</name> at Washington.  The wound being very painful, he
                                                  did not wish to have it probed, and therefore did
                                                  not tell the attending surgeon that the ball
                                                  remained in the wound. Simple dressings were
                                                  applied. For several weeks he staggered and had
                                                  fever, but never was delirious. Spiculæ of bone
                                                  continued to come away for some weeks, but the
                                                  wound healed gradually, and on <date type="transfer" when="1862-10-03">October 3d</date> the
