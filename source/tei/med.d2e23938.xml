     wound was from a minié ball, which entered at the dorsal surface and was taken out at the
     plantar aspect, having fractured the metatarsal bone of the great toe. Gangrene set in,
     destroying the continuity of the dorsalis pedis artery and necessitating ligation, which was
     performed on <date type="operation" when="1864-07-20">July 20th</date> by <name type="person" key="xx">Surgeon A. Heger</name>, <name type="organization" key="190">U. S. A.</name>, in charge of the hospital, who enlarged the
     wound and tied the artery above and below. The case progressed favorably, the gangrene being
     cured and the wound granulating, when the patient was transferred to <name type="hospital" key="428">Judiciary Square Hospital</name> at Washington on <date type="transfer" when="1864-08-06">August 6th</date>." He was subsequently transferred to <name type="place" key="xx">Fort Washington</name>, and on <date type="servicedischarge" when="1865-07-16">July 16,
      1865</date>, he was discharged from service and pensioned by reason of "difficulty in walking
     in consequence of the wound."  <name type="person" key="1398">Examining Surgeon J. O.

     great toe."  The pensioner died at the <name type="hospital" key="452">Soldier's Home</name>,
     Washington, D. C., <date type="death" when="1878-11-06">November 6, 1878</date>.</p>
