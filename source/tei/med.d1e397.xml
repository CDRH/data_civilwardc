                                <date type="admit" when="1864-10-10">October 10, 1864</date>. The
                                patient stated that he had suffered for some time from regular
                                paroxysms of ague. His condition on admission indicated great
                                nervous depression. Quinine and whiskey were prescribed, and the
                                bowels moved by compound cathartic pills. Six days later the fever
                                assumed a typhoid type, but this was speedily followed by an
                                improvement, the tongue becoming moist and clean, the pulse 85 and
                                the skin natural. On <date type="death" when="1864-10-21">the
                                        21st</date>, after having been unusually comfortable and
                                even lively during the morning, he complained in the afternoon of
                                dyspnœa, for which counter-irritants were applied, and as there
                                was some cough, an expectorant mixture was given. At 5 P. M., after
                                eating a good meal of bread and milk, he was suddenly seized with
                                intense dyspnœa; in the course of half an hour convulsions set
                                in, and he died shortly after. Stimulants, friction of the
                                extremities, etc., were tried without effect. <hi rend="italic">Post-mortem</hi> examination eighteen hours after death:
                                Both lungs were much congested throughout, with the exception of a
                                small portion of the anterior border of each; they contained no
                                tubercles, nor was any other lesion observed in them. Nothing
                                abnormal could be detected in the stomach or intestines. The liver
                                was healthy. The other organs were not examined.—<hi rend="italic"><name type="hospital" key="189">Third Division
