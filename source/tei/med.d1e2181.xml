                                                Cav.</name>; age 19; was said to have contracted
                                        diarrhœa on <date type="injury" when="1861-09-09">Sept. 9, 1861</date>, and was admitted on <date type="admit" when="1861-09-30">the 30th</date>.
                                        Diagnosis—typhoid fever. He was weak, had a slight
                                        cough, a diarrhœa yielding two stools daily and but
                                        little appetite; pulse 100 and quick; skin natural; tongue
                                        moist, but coated in the centre. Next day he was dull; had
                                        some headache and tenderness in the right iliac region. On
                                        October 2d the tongue was dry, brown and fissured in the
                                        centre. No change was noted on the 3d, but on the 4th his
                                        pupils were dilated; he was delirious and had a wild look.
                                        The delirium abated somewhat on the 6th; the tongue became
                                        dry, red and fissured by the 10th, but the appetite improved
                                        and the bowels continued unmoved for several days, the pulse
                                        beating 75 to 80 per minute, although there was some
                                        abdominal tenderness and tympanites, with flushed cheeks,
                                        injected eyes and nocturnal delirium. The patient perspired
                                        during the night, and next morning the tongue was red at the
                                        tip and edges and coated white in the centre; there was less
                                        delirium and the appetite was good. On the 12th the tongue
                                        was moist and clean but for a yellowish streak on each side
                                        of the centre. One stool was obtained on the 14th, after the
                                        administration of two compound cathartic pills. The tongue
                                        on the 17th was moist and clean but for some white patches.
                                        The patient steadily improved and was returned to duty <date type="duty" when="1861-11-13">November 13</date>.
