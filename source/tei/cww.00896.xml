                        in his behalf, for the following among other reasons,—that he had a wife and
                        children residing in <placeName>Georgetown D.C</placeName>,—that, his master had
                            for certain considerations given him a chance to purchase
                            himself;—that he had paid a portion thereon leaving a balance due
                            of $600.00, or thereabouts, but he felt anxious to make an arrangement
                            by which, within a specified time, he could acquire his freedom, and, in
                            the meantime be near his family and without the prospect of being
                            separated therefrom.</p>
                    <p>He was regarded as a valuable hand, being competent to perform generally
                        mechanical labor required on a farm. I therefore advanced to his master the
                        sum of $600.00,—agreeing to allow to said <persName>Perry</persName>
                        $150.00 per annum for his labor, exclusive of clothing and board; and that,
                        if by any proper means he could re-imburse me in kind within the period of
                        four years, I was, and did agree, to manumit him. He <choice>
