                        the value of his claim should conclude with an averment that he has no

                <p>And your petitioner further states and alleges, that <seg type="handwritten">she</seg> has not brought said <seg type="handwritten"><persName>Joanna Penn</persName></seg> into the District of Columbia since the passage of
                    said act of Congress; and that, at the time of the passage thereof, said <seg type="handwritten"><persName>Joanna Penn</persName></seg> was held to
                    service or labor therein under and by virtue of your petitioner's claim to such
                    service or labor.</p>

                <p>Your petitioner further states and alleges, that <seg type="handwritten">her</seg> said claim to the service or labor of <seg type="handwritten">the</seg> said <seg type="handwritten">female <persName>Joanna Penn</persName></seg> does not originate in or by virtue of any transfer
