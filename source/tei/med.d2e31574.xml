An autopsy was made by <name type="person" key="245">Assitant Surgeon H. Allen</name>, <name type="organization" key="190">U. S. A.</name>  The wound was in the median line, five inches above the pubis; the stomach was distended with gas; the intestines were natural in position, not abnormally distended, but greatly discolored by hæmorrhage. A moderately sized venous clot was found on the inferior surface of the omentum. The cellular tissue about the mesentery was emphysematous. The posterior part of the abdomen was filled with a large black clot, in the midst of which was an <choice><orig>ascaris lumbricoides</orig><reg>Ascaris lumbricoides</reg></choice>. The missile, a conical carbine ball (<hi rend="initialcap">F</hi>IG. 48), was found in the pubis on the right side of the bladder, lying on the peritoneum. The lining of the œsophagus was unusually pale; the epiglottis presented a peculiar appearance, its mucous lining being of a purple color, with several dark grayish spots upon its laryngeal surface. The liver weighed thirty-four and one-fourth ounces, and was of an intense green color; the kidneys were extremely flabby and anæmic, and the cellular tissue surrounding them, emphysematous. The right kidney weighed five and one-half ounces, and measured five by two and one-half inches; the left weighed six and one-half ounces, and measured five by two and one-half inches. The spleen weighed four ounces, and measured four and one-half by three inches. Two sections of the small intestine, showing perforations by the missile, are figured in the wood-cut (<hi rend="initialcap">F</hi>IG. 49).  The specimens were contributed to <name type="hospital" key="431">the Museum</name> by <name type="person" key="76">Surgeon G. S. Palmer</name>, <name type="organization" key="132">U. S.
