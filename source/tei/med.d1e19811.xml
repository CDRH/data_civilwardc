          B——</name>, <name type="organization" key="xxx">Co. D, 12th New Hampshire
          Volunteers</name>, aged 21 years, was admitted to <name type="hospital" key="172">Emory
          Hospital</name>, Washington, <date type="admit" when="1864-06-11">June 11th, 1864</date>,
        with a gunshot wound of the right shoulder, received at <name type="BATTLE" key="263">Cold
          Harbor</name> on <date type="injury" when="1864-06-03">the 3d</date>. A minié ball
        entered below the clavicle and passed out at the anterior aspect of the arm, about three
        inches below the shoulder joint. He also received a flesh wound of the upper third of the
        right thigh. The patient had a hæmorrhagic diathesis, which his father stated was
        hereditary in the family—for example, a simple cut of the finger would cause
        hæmorrhage to such an amount as to endanger life. Under these circumstances, and upon
        consultation, it was decided after his first attack of hæmorrhage to ligate the
        subclavian. The operation was successfully performed on <date type="operation" when="1864-06-17">June 17th</date>, by <name type="person" key="884">Surgeon N. R.
          Moseley</name>, <name type="organization" key="132">U. S. V.</name> Strong hopes were
        entertained of the patient's recovery; but, unfortunately, in addition to his peculiar
        diathesis, he had a severe cough, which it seemed almost impossible to relieve or arrest
        temporarily. On the morning of <date type="death" when="1864-06-29">the 29th</date>, while
        in conversation, the artery gave way, and death was almost instantaneous from
        hæmorrhage. The adjacent wood-cut represents the specimen, which was prepared and
        presented, with the notes of the case, by <name type="person" key="884">Surgeon N. R.
          Moseley</name>, the operator. It consists of a portion of the innominata and of the
        subclavian and carotid, and is figured in the wood-cut (<hi rend="initialcap">F</hi>IG.
        247). There were slight fibrinous exudations on either side of the point at which the
        ligature cut through. The commencement of the vertebral and superior intercostal are shown,
        and the thyroid axis and transversus colli.</p>
