The pharynx was dark-purple; the œsophagus of a white color above, stone-
                                        blue mixed with ochre color below. The epiglottis was not
                                        thickened but highly injected, especially at its free edge;
                                        at the central <choice><orig>basil</orig><reg>basal</reg></choice> portion was a darkened spot about the
                                        size of a pea. The vocal chords were ulcerated posteriorly,
                                        the ulcers linear, with high, roundish, pale walls and the
                                        mucous membrane around of a dark-purplish color. The sides
                                        of the larynx, below this point, were of a stone-blue color
                                        and considerably injected. The trachea was intensely purple
                                        but not thickened. The bronchial glands were large and
                                        blackened. The first and second lobes of the right lung were
                                        slightly engorged, the third lobe splenified; weight of lung
                                        thirty-five ounces. The left lung was hepatized gray; its
                                        central portion was of a darker hue than the rest of the
                                        tissue and appeared to be in the last stage of red
                                        hepatization; weight seventy-five ounces. The heart
                                        contained venous clots on both sides. The liver was healthy
                                        but weighed ninety-five ounces; the gall-bladder was empty;
                                        the spleen, dark and pultaceous, weighed ten ounces; the
                                        pancreas, firm and whitish, four ounces; the kidneys were
                                        intensely congested. —<hi rend="italic"><name type="person" key="245">Ass't Surgeon Harrison Allen</name>,   <name type="organization" key="190">U. S.
